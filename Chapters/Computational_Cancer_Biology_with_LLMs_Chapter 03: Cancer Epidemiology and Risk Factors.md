# Chapter 3: Cancer Epidemiology and Risk Factors

## 3.1 Global Cancer Incidence and Mortality

### 3.1.1 Current Global Cancer Burden 

#### Contemporary Global Cancer Statistics

According to the latest GLOBOCAN 2022 estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers) alongside 9.7 million cancer deaths worldwide. For both sexes combined, there were an estimated 20.0 million new cases worldwide (19.96 million including NMSC and 18.73 million excluding NMSC) and 9.7 million cancer deaths (9.74 million including NMSC and 9.67 million excluding NMSC) in 2022.

The disease causes three in 10 global premature deaths from NCDs (30.3% in those aged 30–69 years), and it is among the three leading causes of death in this age group in 177 of 183 countries. In addition to being an important barrier to increasing life expectancy, cancer is associated with substantial societal and macroeconomic costs that vary in degree across cancer types, geography, and gender.

#### Leading Cancer Types Globally

In males, lung cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide in 2022 (1.57 million new cases [95% UI: 1.56-1.58]), followed by prostate cancer (1.47 million [1.46-1.48]). With 2.30 million (2.28-2.30) new cases estimated in 2022, breast cancer was the most diagnosed cancer in females, followed by lung cancer (0.91 million [0.90-0.91 million]) and cervical cancer (0.66 million [0.66-0.67]).

In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%). Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers.

#### Regional Distribution of Cancer Burden

Almost one half of all cases (49.2%) and the majority (56.1%) of cancer deaths globally were estimated to occur in Asia in 2022, where 59.2% of the world's population resides. The cancer mortality burden in the African and Asian regions is disproportionately greater than the corresponding incidence burden. This reflects the respective distribution of cancer types alongside comparatively higher case fatality rates on these continents in part because of late-stage diagnoses.

Europe has a disproportionately higher cancer incidence and mortality burden, given that the continent has one fifth of the global cancer cases (22.4%) and cancer deaths (20.4%) yet less than 10% of the global population (9.6%).

#### Human Development Index and Cancer Patterns

Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively).

Although lung cancer is the most frequent cancer type worldwide and in China, female breast cancer is the most common form of incidence at each level of HDI and in India. Colorectal cancer is among the top five leading cancers for both incidence and mortality across HDI levels (also in China but not India), as is liver cancer (although only for mortality).

#### Future Projections

The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy.

One recent study illustrated the profound impact of disproportional cancer mortality in women: an estimated one million children became maternal orphans in 2020 because their mother died from cancer in that year, with close to one half of these orphans the result of maternal deaths from either female breast or cervical cancer.

### 3.1.2 Regional Variations in Cancer Burden

**High-Income Countries (HICs)**

In the USA and other high-income countries, declines in smoking prevalence have resulted in substantial decreases in incidence rates of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer. Elsewhere, and especially in low- and middle-income countries, the cancer burden from smoking continues to increase as a result of population growth and the ageing of smokers.

**Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)**

The majority of cancer cases globally now occur in LMIC, and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide occur in these countries. These countries face a distinct cancer profile characterized by:

In countries with medium HDI, there is still a large burden of infection-related cancers, including cancers of the stomach, liver, and oesophagus. In 2012, the proportion of new cancer cases attributable to infectious agents was 25.3%, 21.5%, 13.2%, and 7.6% in countries with low, medium, high, and very high HDI, respectively.

**Regional Cancer Patterns**

The incidence of colon and rectal cancers varies about 25-fold from the high-income and high incidence areas (North America, Australia and New Zealand, Western Europe, and Japan) to Africa and Asia, where incidence is lowest. Specific regional patterns include:

- **Colorectal cancer**: Where rates historically have been low (particularly in Asia), they seem to be rising
- **Breast cancer**: Breast cancer is increasing in incidence everywhere, but more so where rates historically have been low. In China, annual increases of 3 to 4 percent are reported
- **Liver cancer**: Although it is sixth in incidence worldwide, it is third in mortality, after lung and stomach cancers. With 5-year survival at 5 percent or less even in developed countries

### 3.1.3 Temporal Trends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality

#### Overall Trends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality

The global landscape of cancer incidence and mortality in 2022 reflects ongoing trends observed in 2020. Cancer burdens vary notably across countries with differing socioeconomic statuses. Decreases in stomach, liver, and esophageal cancer cases and deaths signify progress in cancer control efforts. The decrease in the global MIRs highlights potential improvements in cancer management.

#### Site-Specific Temporal Patterns

##### Colorectal Cancer Trends

Patterns and trends in CRC incidence and mortality correlate with present human development levels and their incremental changes might reflect the adoption of more western lifestyles. Generally, CRC incidence and mortality rates are still rising rapidly in many low-income and middle-income countries; stabilising or decreasing trends tend to be seen in highly developed countries where rates remain among the highest in the world.

##### Breast Cancer Trends

The global BC mortality rate increased overall by 0.23% per year (95% CI=0.20, 0.25), with statistically significant increases in the under 50 and 70 and over age groups, and in 5 out of 7 regions. Annual rates increased by 1-5% in half of examined countries. Mortality rates decreased in 29 countries with very high Human Development Index (HDI), and seven countries (for example, Belgium and Denmark) are meeting the Global Breast Cancer Initiative goal of at least a 2.5% annual reduction.

The global burden of breast cancer is rising fast and varies greatly among countries. The incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer increased rapidly in China and South Korea but decreased in the USA.

##### Prostate Cancer Trends

According to the most recent 10-yr temporal data available, most countries experienced increases in incidence, with sharp rises in incidence rates in Asia and Northern and Western Europe. A substantial reduction in mortality rates was reported in most countries, except in some Asian countries and Eastern Europe, where mortality increased.

The magnitude of increasing incidence and decreasing mortality of prostate cancer is attenuated in the recent period.

#### Socioeconomic Patterns in Temporal Trends

Socioeconomic patterns in all-cancer, lung, and colorectal cancer mortality changed dramatically over time. Individuals in more deprived areas or lower education and income groups had higher mortality and incidence rates than their more affluent counterparts, with excess risk being particularly marked for lung, colorectal, cervical, stomach, and liver cancer.

Area socioeconomic patterns in U.S. male cancer mortality changed dramatically between 1950 and 1998. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, there was a positive socioeconomic gradient, with higher cancer mortality rates in high area socioeconomic groups than in low area socioeconomic groups. For example, in 1950-1952, cancer mortality was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 41% to 59%) greater in the highest area socioeconomic group than in the lowest.

#### Factors Driving Temporal Changes

Conversely, the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths from stomach and esophageal cancer decreased significantly in 2022. Noteworthy reductions in both ASMR and absolute mortality numbers were observed in liver, stomach, and esophageal cancers.

Its incidence and mortality varied among countries, with the age-standardized incidence ranging from the highest of 112.3 per 100,000 population in Belgium to the lowest of 35.8 per 100,000 population in Iran, and the age-standardized mortality from the highest of 41.0 per 100,000 population in Fiji to the lowest of 6.4 per 100,000 population in South Korea.

### 3.1.4 Cancer Surveillance and Monitoring Systems

**Population-Based Cancer Registries**

The central purpose of state cancer registries is cancer surveillance, monitoring the burden of cancer for a given population. When registration activities are organized to obtain complete counts of cancer for a given population, the system is said to be "population-based".

The need of accurate data of cancer cases in a country is imperative to develop cancer control programs and screening guidelines. Unless the burden of each cancer type and subtype is known, it is hard to allocate appropriate resources for prevention or treatment of the specific types of cancer.

**International Collaborative Efforts**

IARC is responsible for the compilation, estimation, and reporting of cancer statistics generated through flagship projects and databases, including Cancer Incidence in Five Continents and GLOBOCAN, for which the resulting statistics are disseminated on the Global Cancer Observatory.

IARC gathers data on incidence, mortality, and survival for hundreds of countries. The data are available electronically and in published reports. Most prominently, the 8th edition of its report, Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, includes information on more than 200 countries. IARC also estimates cancer incidence and mortality for every country in the world in its GLOBOCAN electronic database.

**Data Quality Challenges**

About 18 percent of low-income countries have recorded mortality data any time since 1950, and about 35 percent have published some population-based incidence data, although fewer than half of them are represented in the most recent edition of IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents.

With a greater number of governments adopting national cancer control plans, attention is increasingly turning to population-based cancer surveillance data as a central component in prioritizing and evaluating interventions. For many LMICs, national vital statistics are unavailable, partial, or inaccurate.

## 3.2 Genetic vs. Environmental Contributions

### 3.2.1 Frameworks for Understanding Cancer Causation

**Multifactorial Models of Disease**

The second approach to studying how variations in genes contribute to variations in disease risk focuses on understanding the genetic susceptibility to diseases as the consequence of the joint effects of many genes, each with small to moderate effects and often interacting among themselves and with the environment to give rise to the distribution of disease risk seen in a population.

In most cases, the combined effects of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors determine a person's likelihood of being affected with a condition, such as cancer. Clustering of cancer among relatives is common. However, determining the underlying causes of this is difficult when there is not a clear pattern of cancer in the family.

**Gene-Environment Interactions**

The interactions of multiple modifier genes with various environmental factors—that is, gene–environment interactions—explain why cancer rates vary across populations, among exposed groups, and even within families.

Multiple genes can interaction with a number of environments in the development of cancer. The macroenvironment—our lifestyle, the air we breathe, the food we eat, the chemicals we are exposed to, as well as viruses, radiation, and physical agents we come in contact with—combines with the microenvironment of our cells to either prevent or enhance carcinogenesis.

### 3.2.2 Evidence for Genetic Contributions

**Family Studies and Hereditary Risk**

Family history is often one of the strongest risk factors for common disease complexes such as cancer. A person inherits a complete set of genes from each parent, as well as a vast array of cultural and socioeconomic experiences from his/her family. Family history is thought to be a good predictor of an individual's disease risk because family members most closely represent the unique genomic and environmental interactions that an individual experiences.

Shared environmental risk factors may contribute heavily to the familial occurrence of cancer, e.g., a familial habit of heavy smoking to the clustering of lung cancer, and they should be ascertained. A negative family history of cancer does not exclude a familial cancer syndrome for several reasons. Virtually none of the germline mutations involved in hereditary cancer have a 100% penetrance.

**High-Penetrance Cancer Susceptibility Genes**

Pathogenic variants in high-penetrance genes have been identified as the cause of inherited cancer risk in some colon cancer–prone families; these are estimated to account for only 5% to 6% of CRC cases overall. In addition, pathogenic variants in lower-penetrance genes may contribute to familial colon cancer risk.

Major genes are typically considered those that are involved in single-gene disorders, and the diseases caused by major genes are often relatively rare. Most pathogenic variants in major genes lead to a very high risk of disease, and environmental contributions are often difficult to recognize.

**Moderate and Low-Penetrance Variants**

The polymorphic susceptibility genes or genetic variants are generally associated with low penetrance and low relative and absolute risks, but they are very common in the population (more than 1 percent) and may be involved in a high proportion of cancers through biologic interactions with environmental or endogenous exposures.

### 3.2.3 Evidence for Environmental Contributions 

#### Gene-Environment Interaction Framework

Recent investigations have pointed out that gene–environmental interactions represent one of the major risk factors associated with cancer etiology. Scientific studies have indicated that genetic polymorphisms are involved in the activation of several biological processes, such as apoptosis, DNA synthesis and methylation, cell cycle regulation, and transcription.

A growing body of knowledge dramatically illustrates the influence of the environment, genes, and their interactions in the international variation reported in cancer incidence. A variety of linkages clearly exist between environmental exposures, diet, lifestyle factors, and cancer.

#### Environmental Exposure Significance

Environmental exposures are responsible for 70%–90% of disease risk. While genetic studies commonly estimate heritability, defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation due to genetic variability, estimating the proportion of variability due to the exposome is challenging because of issues with direct exposure measurements.

Multiple, often interacting, genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of diseases, with an estimated 50%–80% of overall disease etiology based on environmental factors.

#### Mechanistic Understanding

An increase in the amount of carcinogens in the environment has contributed to a global increase in cancer incidence. When carcinogens directly contribute to tumor development, often through a combination of somatic mutations and epigenetic modifications, these changes can directly result in genotype-dependent alterations impacting DNA repair mechanisms or gene regulatory mechanisms.

Much of the work on identifying functional polymorphisms that influence an individual's cancer risk has focused on gene products involved in the activation and detoxification of carcinogens and, more recently, on DNA repair.

#### Complex Interaction Patterns

Several epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated that many human diseases are not only caused by specific genetic and environmental factors but also by gene–environment interactions. Scientific evidence suggests that the etiology of many chronic illnesses is caused by the joint effect between genetics and the environment.

While lifestyle choices or behavioral patterns remain the most significant factors influencing cancer risk, environmental exposure to certain chemicals, both manufactured and natural, may also contribute to an individual's likelihood of developing cancer. This interplay of factors, coupled with an aging demographic and shifting lifestyle patterns, has led to an increasing prevalence of cancer in recent years.

#### Examples of Gene-Environment Interactions

Such gene–environment interactions have been identified for bladder cancer, where smokers carrying variants in two carcinogen-metabolising genes (NAT2 and GSTM1) are at higher risk of disease compared with non-smokers, as well as for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where alcohol users carrying variants in the alcohol-metabolising pathway (ADH1B and ALDH2) are at higher risk compared with non-users.

Lesseur et al. performed a study in New Hampshire to examine the interactions between genes and the environment. Specifically, they investigated the effects of genetic variations and low levels of arsenic exposure on a community. The researchers highlighted that the likelihood of developing bladder cancer may be linked to the genetic variation in a gene responsible for arsenic metabolism and oxidative stress.

#### Air Pollution and Cancer

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that exposure to ozone and ambient air pollution, defined in their global burden estimates as particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 µm (PM2.5), can be attributed to 4 to 9 million global deaths annually. Studies investigating the associations between PM2.5 and adverse health outcomes have implicated the particulate matter in the initiation and progression of multiple diseases including cardiovascular disease, asthma, and lung cancer, with the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifying both outdoor pollution and its relevant constituents as carcinogenic to humans.

### 3.2.4 Integrating Genetic and Environmental Factors

**Gene-Environment Interaction Research**

The study of gene-environment and gene-gene interactions represents a broad class of genetic association studies focused on understanding how human genetic variability is associated with differential responses to environmental exposures and with differential effects depending on variations in other genes.

Much of the work on identifying functional polymorphisms that influence an individual's cancer risk has focused on gene products involved in the activation and detoxification of carcinogens and, more recently, on DNA repair.

**Molecular Epidemiology Approaches**

Recent progress in identifying and characterizing highly penetrant susceptibility genes in familial cancer has revolutionized our understanding of the critical genetic mechanisms in cancer etiology. Studies that combine genetic analysis with assessment of exposures and diet can explain why not everyone exposed to a particular cancer-causing chemical will develop cancer.

## 3.3 Lifestyle-Associated Cancers

### 3.3.1 Tobacco Use

**Epidemiological Evidence**

Smoking accounts for at least 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 80 percent of lung cancer deaths. Lung cancer, for which smoking is the primary risk factor, is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. However, smoking heightens the risk of up to 18 types of cancers, including head and neck cancers, leukemia, and cancers of the esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, liver, stomach, colorectum, cervix, uterus, and ovaries.

Tobacco, through its various forms of exposure, constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide among men, and increasingly among women. Forms of exposure include active smoking, breathing secondhand tobacco smoke (passive or involuntary smoking) and smokeless tobacco. The total death toll in 2005 from tobacco use was estimated at 5.4 million people, including about 1.5 million cancer deaths.

**Carcinogenic Mechanisms**

Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 compounds, at least 60 of which are known carcinogens. Inhaling this mix of chemicals through smoke induces tissue injury and changes in the cellular environment that foster proliferation and transformation into cancer cells.

There are more than 7,000 chemicals in combustible tobacco cigarette smoke, and more than 70 are established human carcinogens. In addition to combustible tobacco cigarette smoking, pipe and cigar smoking are established causes of lung cancer. Furthermore, even exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, which results in much lower levels of smoke exposure than active smoking, is causally associated with lung cancer.

**Secondhand Smoke**

The risk of lung cancer in cigarette smokers is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked. Among smokers, an increase in exposure leads to an increase in risk, as long as the additional tobacco smoke, whether through active or passive smoking, reaches the bronchial epithelium.

One meta-analysis of 5 cohort and 34 case-control studies found that nonsmoking women who lived with a smoker had an approximately 25 percent greater risk of developing lung cancer than non-smoking women who lived with a nonsmoker.

### 3.3.2 Physical Activity and Obesity

**Physical Activity and Cancer Risk**

Obesity increases the risk of breast, endometrial, colorectal, kidney, and esophageal cancer. Physical inactivity, dietary factors, obesity and being overweight play an important role as causes of cancer. Overweight and obesity are causally associated with several common cancer types, including cancers of the oesophagus, colorectum, breast in postmenopausal women, endometrium and kidney.

**Mechanisms**

Physical inactivity is a major contributor to the rise in rates of overweight and obesity in many parts of the world, and independently increases the risk of some cancers. Because all these factors are intimately interconnected at the individual and contextual levels, estimating the specific contribution of each of these risk factors is difficult and might underestimate the cumulative potential risk.

### 3.3.3 Diet and Nutrition

**Dietary Risk Factors**

Consumption of red meat and processed meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer by an estimated 43 percent. Another major dietary risk factor is high salt intake, which increases the risk of stomach cancer. Globally, salt intake has declined, and the associated cancer burden has declined as a result.

The global network of World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) International comprises registered charities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands as well as the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) in the USA. The WCRF International network was the first organization to focus exclusively on the links between cancer and nutrition, and more recently physical activity.

**Nutritional Epidemiology**

Discoveries that both essential and nonessential dietary nutrients can markedly influence several key biological events—including cell cycle regulation, processes involved in replication or transcription, immunocompetence, and factors involved with apoptosis, or programmed cell death—have strengthened convictions that specific foods or components may markedly influence cancer risk.

## 3.4 Environmental and Occupational Cancer Risks 

### Scope of Environmental and Occupational Carcinogens

As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents.

The recognition of occupational carcinogens is important for primary prevention, compensation and surveillance of exposed workers, as well as identifying causes of cancer in the general population. A total of 120 agents were substances, mixtures or types of radiation classified in IARC Group 1 with 'sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity' in humans from studies of exposed workers and evidence of occupational exposure documented in the apposite monograph.

### Global Burden of Occupational Cancer

Occupational exposure to carcinogens is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, with an estimated occurrence of 666 000 fatal work-related cancers annually. Occupational carcinogens have been shown to cause a considerable disease burden at a national and global level. The WHO Comparative Risk Assessment project was the first attempt to produce comprehensive global estimates of the nature and extent of the burden of cancer arising from occupational exposures.

### Environmental Carcinogen Burden

Despite small relative risks of cancer from exposure to environmental carcinogens, attributable risks have the potential to be large because of the high prevalence of exposure. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 20% of cancers worldwide are attributable to environmental risks, predominantly air pollution, management of chemicals, radiation, and workers' protection.

The cancer burden from environmental agents varies by the degree of industrialization of the country. A unifying characteristic of these agents is the involuntary nature of their exposure from environmental and occupational settings.

### Specific Occupational Carcinogens

Table 2.10.1 lists 50 occupational agents, occupations, and industries that have been classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). The table explicitly distinguishes between 38 chemical or physical agents and 12 occupations and industries that involve an increased risk of cancer but for which the responsible agent has not been specified.

Because tobacco smoking is a potent carcinogen, secondary causes of lung cancer are often diminished in perceived importance. The goal of this review is to describe the occurrence and recent findings of the 27 agents currently listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as lung carcinogens.

### Environmental Exposure Routes and Sources

Risk of cancer can increase through exposure to cancer-causing agents, also referred to as "carcinogens". These agents may be biological (specific viruses or bacteria), physical (ultraviolet light, X-rays) or chemical. Chemicals related to environmental pollution appear to be of critical importance. Of major concern are: outdoor air pollution by carbon particles associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; indoor air pollution by environmental tobacco smoke.

The EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program created in 1985 identifies and characterizes human health hazards associated with chemicals found in the environment. To date, the IRIS's weight-of-evidence approach has identified over 150 of such chemicals as carcinogenic, likely to be carcinogenic, or suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential.

### Challenges in Environmental Carcinogen Research

Since our 2005 review, over one-hundred epidemiological studies have been published investigating the link between environmental and/or occupational exposures and cancer, based on our MEDLINE search. However, we as a society have repeatedly failed to act on this body of evidence to reduce and/or eliminate exposure to carcinogens wherever possible.

We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one that is based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposures to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens in combination with additional important risk factors such as diet and lifestyle.

### Complex Mixtures and Emerging Concerns

The family of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons poses a particular challenge. This class of chemicals includes several potent experimental carcinogens, such as benzo[a]pyrene. However, humans are always exposed to mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; several sources of such mixtures are indicated in Tables 2.10.1 and 2.10.2, including coal tars, soot, and creosotes.

Although the risk fraction attributable to environmental factors is still unknown, this long list of carcinogenic and especially mutagenic factors supports our working hypothesis according to which numerous cancers may in fact be caused by the recent modification of our environment.

## 3.5 Cancer Health Disparities and Social Determinants 

### Framework for Understanding Cancer Disparities

Although cancer mortality rates declined in the United States in recent decades, some populations experienced little benefit from advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship care. In fact, some cancer disparities between populations of low and high socioeconomic status widened during this period.

Cancer disparities reflect the interplay among many factors, including social determinants of health, behavior, biology, and genetics—all of which can have profound effects on health, including cancer risk and outcomes. The Department of Health and Human Services defines social determinants of health as the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect health, functioning, and quality of life.

### Racial and Ethnic Disparities

There are well-established disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes by race/ethnicity that result from the interplay between structural, socioeconomic, socio-environmental, behavioural and biological factors. However, large research studies designed to investigate factors contributing to cancer aetiology and progression have mainly focused on populations of European origin.

Black/African American people have higher death rates than all other racial/ethnic groups for many, although not all, cancer types. Despite having slightly lower incidence rates of breast cancer than those of White women, Black/African American women are more likely than White women to die of the disease.

Substantial disparities in the incidence and mortality rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) exist in the USA among racially and ethnically diverse populations. AA/Bs have the highest incidence rates of CRC (45.7/100,000) as compared with AI/ANs (43.3), NHWs (38.6), Hispanics/Latinos (34.1) and some Asian populations (30.0).

### Social Determinants of Health

Disparities in cancer care and outcomes between racial and ethnic groups, urban and rural populations, and socioeconomic classes are well documented and represent one of the greatest forms of injustice throughout the United States. Despite the development of increasingly efficacious treatments, survival disparities have widened over time, with known impacts based on both medical factors and social determinants of health including education, neighborhood, factors, and access to care, among others.

Freeman's health disparities cancer model provides a framework for organizing racial and ethnic disparities in cancer research. The model is based on the premise that social setting contributes to disease outcome and considers 3 major variables, ie, poverty, culture, and social justice, and posits an important connection between the social determinants of health and health inequities.

### Healthcare Access and Quality

Socioeconomic factors and physician supply are key predictors of CRC screening. Adjustment for socioeconomic determinants explained black-white disparities; further adjustment for physician supply explained Hispanic-white disparities. Physician distribution is a potentially remediable contributor to ethnic/racial disparities in CRC screening.

Research suggests that cancer disparities are driven by a combination of inequities within and beyond the health system that are rooted in racism and discrimination. People of color are more likely than their White counterparts to be uninsured and to face other barriers to accessing health care that may limit access to cancer screening, care, and treatment.

### Biological and Genetic Factors

For example, some evidence suggests that there are differences in the genetics, tumor biology, and immune environment of several cancers that arise in Black/African Americans compared with those that arise in people of other racial/ethnic groups. These differences may contribute to disparities in incidence, cancer growth rate, and response to treatment of these cancers.

As an example of the link between genetic ancestry and burden of cancer, Black women in the U.S. have a disproportionately higher rate of developing TNBC, a particularly aggressive type of breast cancer, compared to White women. Researchers have found that TNBC is more prevalent in Black women who trace their ancestry to West Africa, and more specifically to Ghana.

### Consequences of Disparities

Racial disparities in breast cancer mortality have been widely documented for several decades and persist despite advances in receipt of mammography across racial groups. This persistence leads to questions about the roles of biological, social, and health system determinants of poor outcomes.

Many potentially preventable cancer deaths continue to occur, and disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden. Reducing the burden of cancer and eliminating cancer-related disparities will require more focused and coordinated action across multiple sectors and in partnership with communities.

## Summary

The global cancer burden continues to evolve in response to demographic transitions, changing risk factor patterns, and varying levels of healthcare infrastructure. Changing fertility patterns and increasing life expectancy are leading to major changes in the scale of the cancer problem worldwide for populations at all levels of human development. A cancer transition is clearly underway in countries transiting to high levels of income and development whereby reductions in infection-related cancers are offset by concomitant increases in cancers linked to a "Westernization" of lifestyle.

Adequate surveillance mechanisms at the country level are needed to monitor progress. With a greater number of governments adopting national cancer control plans, attention is increasingly turning to population-based cancer surveillance data as a central component in prioritizing and evaluating interventions.

The evidence demonstrates that cancer remains a complex disease influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, with the relative contributions varying by cancer type and population. The big challenge for epidemiology now is to develop strategies to ensure that the advances in human genomics are incorporated appropriately into population studies, as well as family-based, and hybrid studies. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing effective, evidence-based cancer prevention and control strategies that address the diverse needs of populations worldwide.
