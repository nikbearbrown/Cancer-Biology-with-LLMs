# Chapter 34: Pediatric Cancers

Pediatric cancers represent a distinct category of malignancies that differ significantly from adult cancers in their biology, presentation, treatment approaches, and outcomes. While leukemias constitute the most common pediatric malignancies, solid tumors account for approximately 40% of childhood cancers. This chapter focuses on three major pediatric solid tumors: neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, and medulloblastoma. These embryonal tumors arise from developing tissues and demonstrate unique characteristics that reflect their origin from immature, rapidly dividing cells during organ development.

## 34.1 Neuroblastoma

### Introduction and Epidemiology

Neuroblastoma is the most frequently occurring extracranial childhood tumor, classified as an embryonal neuroendocrine tumor originating from neural crest progenitor cells. It accounts for 8-10% of all pediatric neoplasms and approximately 15% of cancer deaths in pediatrics, with an incidence of 10.5 per million children under 15 years of age. Neuroblastoma constitutes the fourth most common malignant tumor in children and represents approximately 7% to 10% of childhood malignancy, making it the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood.

The disease demonstrates a striking age distribution, with 90% of cases diagnosed before age 6 and a median age at diagnosis of 22 months. Non-Hispanic White patients have a higher risk of developing neuroblastoma than all other race and ethnicity groups. There is a slight male predominance with a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1.

### Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system, including the superior cervical, paraspinal, and celiac ganglia; the majority arise in the adrenal glands. During embryogenesis, neuroblasts invaginate and migrate along the neuraxis, populating the adrenal medulla, sympathetic ganglia, the Meissner (submucosus) and Auerbach (myenteric) plexuses of the gastrointestinal tracts as well as other sites.

The tumor demonstrates remarkable biological heterogeneity, ranging from spontaneous regression to aggressive metastatic disease. Biologically, neuroblastomas can be divided into two major groups: one characterized by chromosomal multiplication and hyperdiploidy associated with good clinical prognosis, while gene amplification affecting N-myc characterizes a group of highly aggressive neoplasms with poor prognosis.

#### Key Molecular Alterations

**MYCN Amplification**: Present in approximately 20-25% of neuroblastomas, MYCN amplification is strongly associated with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis.

**Chromosomal Abnormalities**: 
- Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 1p36
- Deletions of 11q
- Gains of chromosome 17q

**Telomere Maintenance Mechanisms**: High-risk neuroblastoma tumors harbor aberrant genetic mechanisms for telomere lengthening, including chromosomal rearrangements involving the TERT gene at 5p15.33, which occur in approximately 20% to 25% of high-risk cases and are mutually exclusive with MYCN amplifications.

### Clinical Presentation

Due to high variability in presentation, clinical signs and symptoms can range from a benign palpable mass with distension to major illness from substantial tumor spread. The clinical manifestations depend largely on the primary tumor location and the presence of metastatic disease.

#### Primary Tumor Effects
- **Abdominal mass**: Most common presentation when arising from adrenal glands
- **Horner syndrome**: When involving superior cervical ganglia (ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis)
- **Spinal cord compression**: When arising from paraspinal locations
- **Respiratory symptoms**: When arising from thoracic sympathetic chain

#### Metastatic Disease
Over half of all neuroblastoma patients have hematogenous spread at diagnosis, with disease involving bone and bone marrow (56% and 71% respectively), followed by lymph nodes (31%), and lungs (3%).

#### Paraneoplastic Syndromes
- **Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome**: Associated with better prognosis
- **Hypertension**: Due to catecholamine excess
- **Watery diarrhea**: Due to vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion

### Diagnosis and Staging

#### Biochemical Markers
Since neuroblastoma cells produce catecholamines, breakdown products including homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) are elevated in urine in over 90% of cases.

#### Histological Features
Histological confirmation requires identification of small round pale blue cells, known as Homer-Wright pseudorosettes. The International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) identifies four basic categories: neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-poor), ganglioneuroblastoma intermixed, ganglioneuroblastoma nodular, and ganglioneuroma.

#### Risk Stratification
The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) developed a consensus approach using patient age, tumor stage, tumor grade and differentiation, histology, MYCN amplification, cytogenetic aberrations in 11q, and DNA ploidy, defining 16 pre-treatment groups broadly divisible into four prognostic subgroups based on five-year event-free survival:

- **Very low risk**: >85% five-year event-free survival
- **Low risk**: 75-85% five-year event-free survival  
- **Intermediate risk**: 50-75% five-year event-free survival
- **High risk**: <50% five-year event-free survival

### Treatment Approaches

Treatment strategies are risk-stratified based on clinical and biological factors:

#### Low and Intermediate Risk
- Surgery alone for localized, resectable tumors
- Observation for stage 4S disease with spontaneous regression potential
- Moderate-intensity chemotherapy for intermediate-risk disease

#### High Risk
- Intensive multimodal therapy including:
  - Induction chemotherapy
  - Surgical resection
  - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue
  - Radiation therapy
  - Immunotherapy with anti-GD2 antibodies
  - Maintenance therapy with retinoids

### Prognosis

Over 50% of newly diagnosed neuroblastomas are very low or low risk with excellent outcomes. However, high-risk disease continues to have poor outcomes despite intensive therapy. While relapsed neuroblastoma was previously believed to be universally fatal, there have been reports of salvage using radiation, chemotherapy, and/or combined chemo-immunotherapy, with many children now surviving for years on chronic active therapy with reasonable quality of life.

## 34.2 Wilms Tumor

### Introduction and Epidemiology

Wilms tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common renal cancer in the pediatric age group, the most common pediatric abdominal cancer, and the fourth most common pediatric cancer overall. There are approximately 650 new cases in the United States every year, with most tumors (75%) occurring in children less than 5 years of age. The tumor was first described by German physician Dr. Max Wilms in 1899.

The median age of diagnosis is 3.5 years, with 90% of cases diagnosed before age 6. Girls are slightly more likely to develop Wilms tumor than boys. There are notable racial differences, with higher incidence in Africans and African Americans, while East Asians have the lowest incidence and better survival outcomes.

### Molecular Biology and Genetics

The cause of Wilms tumor is believed to be due to genetic alterations affecting normal embryological development of the genitourinary tract. Several key genes have been implicated in Wilms tumorigenesis:

#### Major Genetic Alterations
- **WT1 gene**: Located at 11p13, involved in genitourinary development
- **CTNNB1**: Encodes β-catenin, involved in Wnt signaling
- **WTX gene**: X-linked tumor suppressor
- **TP53**: Associated with anaplastic histology and poor prognosis
- **MYNC**: Contributes to unfavorable outcomes

Genetic markers including WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX gene alterations are found in about one-third of all Wilms tumors, while poorer prognosis is linked to TP53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p, 1q, 11p15, and 16q.

#### Developmental Origin
Wilms tumor is thought to develop from persistent metanephric tissue or nephrogenic rests, which may occur in 1% of infantile kidneys but typically regress during childhood. These abnormal metanephric cells are found in up to 100% of cases of bilateral Wilms but only 35% of unilateral tumors.

### Associated Syndromes

Several genetic syndromes predispose to Wilms tumor development:

#### WAGR Syndrome
WAGR syndrome includes Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation. Children with WAGR syndrome have a 50% chance of developing Wilms tumor and have chromosomal abnormalities in the WT1 gene.

#### Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome
Clinically diagnosed by hemihypertrophy, pancreatic enlargement, hypertrophic kidneys, omphalocele, ear creases, macrosomia, and macroglossia. Affected patients have a 5-10% chance of developing Wilms tumor.

#### Denys-Drash Syndrome
Includes male pseudo-hermaphroditism and progressive renal failure starting in infancy, with 90% of affected individuals eventually developing Wilms tumor.

### Histopathology

The histological features of Wilms tumor closely recapitulate those of the developing kidney, with both composed of three elements: blastema (primitive metanephric tissue), epithelium (primitive and mature tubular structures), and stroma (primitive mesenchymal and mature stromal elements including muscle, cartilage, bone, fat, and other tissues).

#### Favorable vs. Unfavorable Histology

**Favorable Histology** (90% of cases):
Classical histological features include a triphasic pattern of blastema, epithelial, and stromal tissues. The blastema consists of small, round blue cells with active mitotic activity. The epithelial component shows wide variations from early tubular formation to differentiating glomeruli-like structures.

**Unfavorable Histology** (10% of cases):
Characterized by anaplasia, defined as hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei that are three times larger than adjacent cells with abnormal mitotic figures. Anaplasia is associated with poor response to treatment.

### Clinical Presentation

Wilms tumor usually presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass in the majority of children, often discovered by caregivers during bathing. Additional presenting features include:

- **Abdominal pain**: Most common initial symptom (30-40%)
- **Hypertension**: Present in 25% of patients, normalizes after nephrectomy  
- **Hematuria**: Occurs in 12-25% of cases
- **Associated anomalies**: Cryptorchidism, varicocele, hypospadias in boys; congenital uterine anomalies in 10% of girls

### Staging and Risk Assessment

#### Staging System
- **Stage I**: Tumor completely contained within kidney (40-45%)
- **Stage II**: Tumor extends outside kidney but completely resectable (20%)
- **Stage III**: Incomplete surgical removal or peritoneal contamination (20-25%)
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastases (10%)
- **Stage V**: Bilateral kidney involvement (5%)

#### Prognostic Factors
The prognosis varies by tumor stage and histology, with favorable histology showing survival rates of 99% to 86%, while unfavorable histology ranges from 84% to 38% depending on stage. Poor prognostic factors include:

- Anaplastic histology
- Loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p, 16q
- Higher stage disease
- Age older than 2 years
- Large tumor size

### Treatment

Treatment usually involves nephrectomy followed by systemic chemotherapy, though some protocols initiate chemotherapy first. Combination chemotherapy typically includes vincristine and dactinomycin, with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin used for more aggressive disease.

#### Surgical Considerations
- Complete tumor removal when possible
- Lymph node sampling for staging
- Routine biopsies are not recommended as they automatically increase tumor staging to Stage III, requiring radiation and chemotherapy
- For bilateral disease, nephron-sparing surgery is attempted

#### Radiation Therapy
For patients without metastases receiving radiation, initiation within 14 days of surgery appears to improve overall survival.

### Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes clear cell renal sarcoma (second most common childhood renal tumor with worse prognosis), rhabdoid renal tumors (highly malignant with 80% mortality within one year), congenital mesoblastic nephroma (typically in first year of life), and renal cell carcinoma.

Recent MRI diffusion studies suggest that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may help differentiate Wilms tumor from neuroblastoma, with a cutoff ADC value ≥0.645 × 10⁻³ mm²/sec suggesting Wilms tumor.

### Long-term Outcomes and Complications

Present-day survival rates are 80-90%, with the addition of radiation therapy significantly improving outcomes. However, there are long-term complications including increased risk of secondary malignancies, particularly breast cancer in females who received chest radiation.

## 34.3 Medulloblastoma

### Introduction and Epidemiology  

While leukemias are the most common malignancy affecting the pediatric population, brain tumors are the most common solid tumors. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, constituting nearly 20% of all pediatric brain tumors. Embryonal tumors account for 20-25% of primary CNS tumors arising in children, with medulloblastomas comprising the vast majority of pediatric embryonal tumors.

Examining SEER database data from 1973-2007, the annual incidence was six per million children (approximately 450 new pediatric cases per year). Children aged 4-9 years had the highest incidence (44%), followed by adolescents 10-16 years (23%), and infants/toddlers 0-3 years (12%). Pediatric incidence is ten-fold higher than adult incidence, with males affected 1.5 times more than females.

### Pathophysiology and Molecular Biology

Medulloblastoma is thought to originate from granule cell precursors in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum. Tumor growth starts in the fourth ventricle and can completely occupy it, then spreads to the cerebellar vermis and brainstem, seeding the craniospinal axis.

Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant tumor with propensity for local invasion and distant metastatic spread through the subarachnoid system ("drop mets"). Extraneural metastases occur in approximately 7% of pediatric cases, most commonly to bone (78%), lymph nodes (33%), liver (15%), and lungs (11%).

#### Cytogenetic Alterations
The most common cytogenetic mutation is isochromosome 17q, resulting from loss of the short arm (17p) with gain of genetic material from the long arm (17q). Deletions in 17p leading to loss of heterozygosity are also frequently reported.

#### Molecular Subgroups
Recent transcriptional profiling studies revealed four primary molecular subgroups with distinct transcriptomes, proteomes, and cytogenetic signatures: (1) SHH (sonic hedgehog), (2) WNT (wingless), (3) non-SHH/WNT group 3, and (4) non-SHH/WNT group 4.

**WNT Subgroup**:
- Excellent prognosis (>95% five-year survival)
- Often associated with classic histology
- Due to excellent outcomes, the WNT subgroup will be studied separately in future trials to evaluate therapy reduction while maintaining favorable outcomes

**SHH Subgroup**:
- Intermediate prognosis (70-88% five-year survival)
- Associated with desmoplastic/nodular histology in infants
- TP53 mutations confer worse prognosis

**Group 3 and Group 4**:
- Group 4 patients have 65-85% five-year survival, while Group 3 has 40-65% five-year survival, with MYC amplification portending the poorest outcomes

### Histopathological Classifications

The WHO recognizes five histological subtypes: classic (70%), desmoplastic-nodular (15%), large-cell anaplastic (10%), melanotic, and medullomyoblastoma (rare variants comprising 5%).

#### Classic Medulloblastoma
Sheets of small round cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, high invasive tendency, and occasional neuroblastic differentiation.

#### Desmoplastic-Nodular Variant  
Nodules of tumor cells displaying neurocytic differentiation on a collagen-rich matrix; less aggressive than classic variant.

#### Large-Cell Anaplastic Variant
Large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Highly aggressive with high mitotic and apoptotic activity, large areas of necrosis, and especially poor prognosis.

### Clinical Presentation

Given origin in the cerebellum with propensity for spreading into the fourth ventricle, patients present with cerebellar signs including clumsiness, gait disturbances, and obstructive hydrocephalus symptoms such as early morning headaches, nausea/vomiting, double vision, or blurry vision.

#### Signs and Symptoms
- **Increased intracranial pressure**: Morning headaches relieved during the day
- **Cerebellar dysfunction**: Ataxia, truncal unsteadiness, coordination problems
- **Brainstem involvement**: Cranial nerve palsies, diplopia, hearing loss, facial weakness
- **Hydrocephalus**: Due to fourth ventricular obstruction
- **Fundoscopic changes**: Papilledema or optic pallor

Time from symptom onset to diagnosis is usually short, typically 2-3 months.

### Diagnosis and Staging

#### Imaging Studies
- **MRI**: Preferred for anatomical detail and detecting residual disease
- **Spinal MRI**: Essential for detecting metastatic spinal lesions  
- **CT**: May reveal fourth ventricular mass with contrast enhancement

#### CSF Analysis
Lumbar puncture may reveal leptomeningeal tumor spread, though CSF may be normal despite positive MRI. Following surgery, lumbar puncture is delayed at least 2 weeks to avoid false-positive results from surgical dissemination.

#### Risk Stratification
Traditional classification divides patients into average-risk and high-risk based on:
- Age (≥3 years for average risk)
- Extent of residual disease (<1.5 cm for average risk)
- Presence of metastases (absent for average risk)

### Treatment Approaches

Current treatment combines surgical resection with chemotherapy and radiation, with cure rates in average-risk patients reaching 75%. However, treatment-related neurologic, cognitive, and endocrinologic sequelae affect up to 80% of survivors.

#### Surgical Management
- Maximal safe resection to relieve CSF obstruction
- Care must be taken as tumors are friable and can disseminate quickly. More than 40% of patients have residual neurological deficits post-surgery
- Ventriculoperitoneal shunt often necessary for hydrocephalus

#### Radiation Therapy
- Craniospinal radiation for local control and micrometastatic disease
- Should be administered within 4 weeks after surgery to maximize response
- Dose reduction associated with higher relapse rates

#### Targeted Therapies
Based on molecular subgroups:

**SHH Subgroup**: 
SMO inhibitors including vismodegib and sonidegib are in clinical trials for relapsed SHH medulloblastoma

**WNT Subgroup**: 
Given excellent prognosis (>90% five-year survival), current efforts focus on limiting cytotoxic therapies such as reducing radiation doses

### Prognosis and Long-term Outcomes

Five-year survival rates range from 50-90% depending on multiple factors including age, presence of metastases, molecular subgroup, and extent of residual disease. The highest survival rates are seen in WNT subgroup (97-100%), while Group 3 medulloblastoma has the worst outcomes (40-65%).

#### Long-term Complications
Treatment-related sequelae include:
- Neurological and cognitive deficits  
- Growth hormone deficiency
- Learning difficulties
- Gonadotropin and thyroid hormone deficiencies
- Secondary malignancies
- Ototoxicity from chemotherapy

Even after successful treatment, many patients have permanent residual neurological and cognitive deficits, with complete functional recovery taking months to years.

## Conclusion

Neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, and medulloblastoma represent three distinct pediatric embryonal tumors with unique biological characteristics, clinical presentations, and treatment approaches. Advances in molecular classification have revolutionized our understanding of these diseases, leading to risk-stratified treatment protocols that aim to optimize outcomes while minimizing long-term toxicities. Continued research into the molecular basis of these tumors holds promise for developing more targeted, less toxic therapeutic approaches that will improve both survival and quality of life for pediatric cancer survivors.
