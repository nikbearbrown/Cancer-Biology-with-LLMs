# Chapter 9: Cell Cycle Control and Cancer

## Introduction

At the heart of the cell-cycle control system is a family of protein kinases known as cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). The activity of these kinases rises and falls as the cell progresses through the cycle. The oscillations lead directly to cyclical changes in the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that initiate or regulate the major events of the cell cycle—DNA replication, mitosis, and cytokinesis.

Most cells in the body go through a cycle of life in which their genetic information is retained, fixed, and passed down to daughter cells through a highly coordinated and regulated process. However, during this cell cycle, there are many situations where mistakes are made by the cycle or by a regulating system that causes the cell to proliferate uncontrollably, leading to cancer.

The precise control of cell cycle progression is essential for normal development, tissue homeostasis, and prevention of diseases such as cancer. This chapter examines the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell cycle progression and how their disruption contributes to cancer development.

## 9.1 Overview of the Cell Cycle and Its Regulation 

### 9.1.1 Cell Cycle Phases

Eukaryotic cell cycles are divided into four discrete phases: M, G1, S, and G2. M phase consists of mitosis, which is usually followed by cytokinesis. S phase is the period of DNA replication.

Somatic cells are the best known for this cell cycle and go through 2 main phases called interphase and mitosis. After mitosis, where the cells divide into 2 cells, they enter into the G1 phase, which is a place for resting and a checkpoint for complete genetic function before the cells can start replicating the DNA. This DNA replication occurs in the S phase of interphase and plays a crucial role in creating sister chromatids that can then separate later in the cycle. After the S phase, the cell then again enters into a resting state known as G2 before continuing on to complete the cell cycle with mitosis.

Most cells in our body are in G0, but the molecular basis and reversibility of this state vary in different cell types. Neurons and skeletal muscle cells, for example, are in a terminally differentiated G0 state, in which their cell-cycle control system is completely dismantled: the expression of the genes encoding various Cdks and cyclins are permanently turned off, and cell division never occurs.

**Enhanced Content:**

The cell-cycle control system operates much like the control system of an automatic washing machine. Just as a washing machine functions through distinct stages that must occur in proper sequence, the cell cycle is governed by a central controller that triggers each essential process—DNA replication, mitosis, and cytokinesis—in the correct order. This sophisticated control system possesses several critical features: a molecular timer mechanism, safeguards ensuring proper event sequencing, binary switches that trigger complete processes, backup mechanisms for system robustness, and adaptability for different cell types and environmental conditions.

The cell cycle is driven by the coordinated regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are serine/threonine kinases whose catalytic activities are regulated by interactions with cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). There are 20 members of the CDK family known today, regulating not only cell cycle progression but also transcription and RNA splicing processes. The human genome contains CDKs that can be divided into at least three different subfamilies with distinct functions, regulatory mechanisms, expression patterns, and subcellular localization.

The regulation of CDK activity occurs through multiple sophisticated mechanisms:
- **Oscillatory cyclin levels**: The rise and fall of cyclin concentrations serves as the primary determinant of CDK activity throughout the cell cycle
- **Inhibitory phosphorylation**: CDK activity can be suppressed by phosphorylation at specific amino acid residues in the active site, controlled by kinases like Wee1 and phosphatases like Cdc25
- **CDK inhibitor proteins (CKIs)**: Various CKI proteins provide fine-tuned regulation, particularly during G1 and S phases
- **Regulated proteolysis**: Cyclins are destroyed at specific cell cycle stages through ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms involving SCF and APC enzyme complexes

### 9.1.2 Core Components of Cell Cycle Control 

**Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs)**

Cyclical changes in Cdk activity are controlled by a complex array of enzymes and other proteins. The most important of these Cdk regulators are proteins known as cyclins. Cdks, as their name implies, are dependent on cyclins for their activity: unless they are tightly bound to a cyclin, they have no protein kinase activity.

Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases, also known as CDK's, are the 2 major proteins that play a role in regulating the cell cycle. These CDK's are created throughout the cell cycle and are used to phosphorylate downstream proteins essential for healthy cell growth. On the other hand, cyclin is only created during specific times of the cell cycle and acts as a regulator.

**Enhanced Understanding of CDK-Cyclin Complexes:**

Each cyclin-CDK complex serves as a molecular switch that triggers specific cell-cycle events. The sophistication of this system lies not just in cyclin binding activating CDK, but in how cyclins direct their CDK partners to specific target proteins. This substrate specificity ensures that different cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate distinct sets of proteins, enabling precise temporal control of cellular processes.

Structural studies reveal that in the absence of cyclin, the active site in the CDK protein is partially obscured by a protein domain. Cyclin binding causes conformational changes that move this obstruction away from the active site, resulting in partial CDK activation. Full activation occurs when the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) phosphorylates a critical amino acid near the active site entrance, creating the complete conformational change necessary for effective substrate phosphorylation.

**Modern Classification and Functions:**

Recent research has identified specialized roles for different CDK family members:

**Cell Cycle CDKs:**
- **CDK4 and CDK6**: Partner with D-type cyclins to regulate G1 progression and passage through the restriction point
- **CDK2**: Associates with cyclins E and A for G1/S transition and S phase progression  
- **CDK1**: The master regulator that partners with B-type cyclins to control mitotic entry and progression

**Transcriptional CDKs:**
- **CDK7**: Functions in transcription initiation as part of TFIIH and serves as the CDK-activating kinase
- **CDK8 and CDK19**: Form kinase modules with cyclin C to regulate gene expression through the Mediator complex
- **CDK9**: Critical component of P-TEFb complex controlling transcriptional elongation
- **CDK11**: Regulates both transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing
- **CDK12**: Involved in transcriptional elongation and alternative splicing, particularly in DNA damage response

**Specialized CDKs:**
- **CDK5**: Unique CDK activated by p35/p39 rather than cyclins, crucial for neuronal function and development

**Cyclin Classification **

There are four classes of cyclins, each defined by the stage of the cell cycle at which they bind Cdks and function. Three of these classes are required in all eukaryotic cells: G1/S-cyclins bind Cdks at the end of G1 and commit the cell to DNA replication. S-cyclins bind Cdks during S phase and are required for the initiation of DNA replication. M-cyclins promote the events of mitosis. In most cells, a fourth class of cyclins, the G1-cyclins, helps promote passage through Start or the restriction point in late G1.

**Enhanced Cyclin Function Analysis:**

Modern research reveals additional complexity in cyclin function:

**D-type Cyclins (D1, D2, D3)**: Serve as sensors of mitogenic stimuli, linking the cell cycle with external environmental conditions. Their accumulation in response to growth factors results in active CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes that overcome inhibition and drive cells through the restriction point.

**E-type Cyclins**: Critical for G1/S transition and S phase initiation. Cyclin E-CDK2 complexes are essential not only for cell cycle progression but also for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells by phosphorylating key transcription factors like NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2.

**A-type Cyclins**: Function during S phase and G2, with cyclin A1 showing specialized expression in male germ cells during meiosis, while cyclin A2 has broader somatic cell functions.

**B-type Cyclins**: Multiple family members (B1, B2, B3) with evolutionarily conserved roles in G2/M transition. In the testis, cyclin B2 shows highest expression in meiotically dividing spermatocytes, while cyclin B1 is most abundant in post-meiotic spermatids, suggesting specialized functions during gametogenesis.

**Cell Cycle Progression Overview **

An ordered sequence of cyclin-Cdk activities triggers most of the events of the cell cycle. During G1 phase, Cdk activity is reduced to a minimum by Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), cyclin proteolysis, and decreased cyclin gene transcription. When environmental conditions are favorable, G1- and G1/S-Cdks increase in concentration, overcoming these inhibitory barriers in late G1 and triggering the activation of S-Cdk.

**Enhanced Molecular Mechanisms:**

The cell cycle control system employs sophisticated feedback loops and checkpoint mechanisms:

**G1 Phase Stability**: Multiple mechanisms ensure stable CDK inactivity in early G1:
1. **Hct1-APC activation**: Unlike Cdc20-APC which is activated by M-CDK, Hct1-APC is inhibited by M-CDK, creating a temporal switch that maintains cyclin destruction after mitosis
2. **CDK inhibitor accumulation**: Proteins like p27 (mammals) and Sic1 (yeast) bind and inactivate CDK complexes
3. **Transcriptional inhibition**: Decreased cyclin gene expression prevents premature CDK reactivation

**S Phase Initiation Control**: The transition involves formation of pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) at origins of replication. The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) serves as a landing platform for Cdc6 protein and MCM helicase complexes. S-CDK activation not only initiates replication but also prevents re-replication through multiple mechanisms: Cdc6 dissociation and degradation, MCM nuclear export, and maintenance of inhibitory phosphorylations.

**M Phase Regulation**: M-CDK activation involves positive feedback loops where partially activated M-CDK promotes its own activation by phosphorylating the Cdc25 phosphatase (its activator) and inhibiting the Wee1 kinase (its inhibitor). This creates switch-like, all-or-none entry into mitosis.

### 9.1.2 Core Components of Cell Cycle Control

**Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs)**

Cyclical changes in Cdk activity are controlled by a complex array of enzymes and other proteins. The most important of these Cdk regulators are proteins known as cyclins. Cdks, as their name implies, are dependent on cyclins for their activity: unless they are tightly bound to a cyclin, they have no protein kinase activity.

Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases, also known as CDK's, are the 2 major proteins that play a role in regulating the cell cycle. These CDK's are created throughout the cell cycle and are used to phosphorylate downstream proteins essential for healthy cell growth. On the other hand, cyclin is only created during specific times of the cell cycle and acts as a regulator.

**Cyclin Classification**

There are four classes of cyclins, each defined by the stage of the cell cycle at which they bind Cdks and function. Three of these classes are required in all eucaryotic cells: G1/S-cyclins bind Cdks at the end of G1 and commit the cell to DNA replication. S-cyclins bind Cdks during S phase and are required for the initiation of DNA replication. M-cyclins promote the events of mitosis. In most cells, a fourth class of cyclins, the G1-cyclins, helps promote passage through Start or the restriction point in late G1.

**Cell Cycle Progression Overview**

An ordered sequence of cyclin-Cdk activities triggers most of the events of the cell cycle. During G1 phase, Cdk activity is reduced to a minimum by Cdk inhibitors (CKIs), cyclin proteolysis, and decreased cyclin gene transcription. When environmental conditions are favorable, G1- and G1/S-Cdks increase in concentration, overcoming these inhibitory barriers in late G1 and triggering the activation of S-Cdk.

## 9.2 Cell Cycle Checkpoints

### 9.2.1 The Concept of Cell Cycle Checkpoints

Although most checkpoints are not essential for normal cell-cycle progression under ideal conditions, populations of cells with checkpoint defects often accumulate mutations due to occasional malfunctions in DNA replication, DNA repair, or spindle assembly. Some of these mutations can promote the development of cancer.

The restriction point could be considered as a prototype of cell cycle checkpoints. The restriction point is related to mitogen deprivation. Checkpoints are mostly related to DNA damage and mitotic progression.

### 9.2.2 The Restriction Point

Production of two cells from one requires duplication of all molecules and organelles that compose each cell. DNA does not duplicate throughout the cycle but only during several hours in S-phase. During S-phase, the DNAs of the 100,000 genes located on 23 pairs (in humans) of chromosomes are replicated, each in a timely fashion.

As discussed, the restriction "point" lies between the accumulation of cyclins D and E and the activation of cyclin E-CDK2. What is the topological relationship of this GF-dependent restriction point and DNA damage-induced G1 checkpoint? DNA damage targets CDKs by two mechanisms. First is rapid and transient disappearance of cyclin D1. DNA damage-induced pathways target cyclin D and then cyclin E-CDK2.

**Molecular Control of the Restriction Point**

Complexes of Cdk4 and Cdk6 with the D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) play a critical role in progression through the restriction point in G1. Cyclin E is expressed later in G1, and Cdk2/cyclin E complexes are required for the G1 to S transition and initiation of DNA synthesis.

Cdk4, 6/cyclin D complexes then act to drive cells through the restriction point in G1. A key substrate of Cdk4, 6/cyclin D complexes is the tumor suppressor protein Rb, which regulates transcription of genes required for cell cycle progression.

### 9.2.3 DNA Damage Checkpoints

Following DNA damage, a cell undergoes growth arrest to repair DNA. Damaged DNA can propagate during S-phase and mitosis. Therefore, arrest occurs in G1 (before S) and in G2 (before mitosis). Arrest in G1 prevents aberrant replication of damaged DNA, and arrest in G2 allows cells to avoid segregation of defective chromosomes.

**DNA Damage Response Pathways**

Additionally, cancer may also form from a lack of control during DNA sequence breaks. When DNA is damaged, and double-stranded breaks occur, most commonly from UV stress; ATM and ATR proteins can stop cell division until the strand is repaired.

ATM, the product of the gene mutated in the chromosome fragility syndrome ataxia telangiectasia, phosphorylates FANCD2 at serine 222 in response to ionising radiation and activates G1-S checkpoint control. The ATM gene encodes for a protein kinase triggered by ionising radiation that phosphorylates a number of downstream targets such as the tumour suppressor gene p53, the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) protein NBS1, CHK2 and BRCA1, all of which are involved in the S-phase checkpoint activated by ionising radiation.

### 9.2.4 The G2/M Checkpoint

A different molecular mechanism is used to control cell cycle progression through the G2 checkpoint, which prevents entry into mitosis in the presence of unreplicated or damaged DNA. Arrest of the cell cycle at this checkpoint is mediated by a protein kinase called Chk1, which is activated in response to DNA damage or incomplete replication. Chk1 phosphorylates the protein phosphatase Cdc25, thereby preventing Cdc25 from dephosphorylating and activating Cdc2.

**Mitotic Promoting Factor (MPF)**

Once DNA replication has taken place, initiation of a new S phase is prevented until the cell has passed through mitosis. MPF is the key molecule responsible for regulating the G2 to M transition in all eukaryotes. MPF is a dimer of cyclin B and the Cdc2 protein kinase.

If a cell is driven into mitosis before it has finished replicating its DNA, it will pass on broken or incomplete sets of chromosomes to its daughter cells. This disaster is avoided in most cells by a DNA replication checkpoint mechanism, which ensures that the initiation of mitosis cannot occur until the last nucleotide in the genome has been successfully replicated.

## 9.3 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors

### 9.3.1 Families of CDK Inhibitors

In mammalian cells, two families of Cdk inhibitors are responsible for regulating different Cdk/cyclin complexes. Members of the Cip/Kip family regulate all stages of progression through G1 and S phase by inhibiting complexes of Cdk2, 4, and 6 with cyclins A, D, and E. In contrast, members of the Ink4 family are specific for complexes of Cdk4 and 6 with cyclin D, so the Ink4 CKIs only regulate progression through the restriction point in G1.

**Anti-proliferative Signaling**

The best-characterized extracellular inhibitor of animal cell proliferation is TGF-β—a polypeptide factor that inhibits the proliferation of a variety of types of epithelial cells by arresting cell cycle progression in G1. This action of TGF-β appears to be mediated by induction of the Cdk inhibitor p15, which binds to Cdk4, 6/cyclin D complexes. In the resulting absence of Cdk4 activity, Rb phosphorylation is blocked and the cell cycle is arrested in G1.

In addition to p21, p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b), which are pure inhibitors of cyclin D-CDK-4 and -6, are induced through the MAPK pathway. This pathway is involved in p21 and p15 induction by TGF-β. Like contact inhibition, TGF-β can arrest the cell cycle in G1 by inducing p27.

## 9.4 Tumor Suppressor Genes

### 9.4.1 The p53 Tumor Suppressor

**p53 Function and Regulation**

The p53 gene like the Rb gene, is a tumor suppressor gene, i.e., its activity stops the formation of tumors. If a person inherits only one functional copy of the p53 gene from their parents, they are predisposed to cancer and usually develop several independent tumors in a variety of tissues in early adulthood. This condition is rare, and is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell death. The p53 protein is also involved in cell differentiation, DNA repair, senescence and angiogenesis. Wild-type (wt) p53 and intact signaling pathways are essential for the prevention of cancer, consistent with a high tumor incidence observed in p53 null mice and in p53-heterozygous Li-Fraumeni patients.

**p53 Pathway Mechanism**

In the cell, p53 protein binds DNA, which in turn stimulates another gene to produce a protein called p21 that interacts with a cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2). When p21 is complexed with cdk2 the cell cannot pass through to the next stage of cell division. Mutant p53 can no longer bind DNA in an effective way, and as a consequence the p21 protein is not made available to act as the 'stop signal' for cell division.

DNA damage leads to rapid induction of p53, which activates transcription of the Cdk inhibitor p21. The inhibitor p21 blocks cell cycle progression, both by acting as a general inhibitor of Cdk/cyclin complexes and by inhibiting DNA replication by binding to PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen).

**p53 Target Genes**

p53 activates transcription of a number of genes with roles in the control of the cell cycle, including WAF1/CIP1/p21 (which encodes a regulator of Cdk activity), GADD45 (a growth-arrest DNA damage-inducible gene), MDM2 (encoding a protein that is a known negative regulator of p53), and 14-3-3σ (a regulator of G2/M progression), as well as various genes that likely function in apoptosis, including BAX, NOXA, and PUMA.

The main tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cell cycle is p53, which is a transcription factor that plays a role in promoting growth arrest, DNA repair, and eventual apoptosis, or regulated death by the cell in damaging situations. Additionally, p53 also regulates the expression of many inhibitory proteins like p21, GADD45. These proteins can inhibit Cdc2, which is crucial for the cell to progress through mitosis or meiosis.

**p53 Regulation by MDM2**

The Mdm2-p53 interaction is obligatory for p53 degradation. Preventing this interaction is sufficient to protect p53 from degradation. Following various stress stimuli, such as γ-IR and UV, this interaction is interrupted. Phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 (Ser-20), which resides within the Mdm2 binding domain, reduces the affinity of Mdm2 for p53, and enhances the stabilization of p53 in response to γ-IR and UV light.

### 9.4.2 The Retinoblastoma (Rb) Tumor Suppressor

**Rb Function in Cell Cycle Control**

Retinoblastoma (RB): RB gene, also called 'Governor of the Cell Cycle,' encodes the RB protein that, when hypophosphorylated, binds and inhibits E2F transcriptions factors. These transcription factors regulate genes that are essential for cells to pass from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Typical growth factor signaling causes RB hyperphosphorylation and inactivation, thus causing cell cycle progression.

The Rb gene encodes the Rb protein, which is a universal regulator of the cell cycle that is normally expressed in almost all the cells of the body. Because it acts as one of the main brakes on progress through the cell-division cycle, the loss of Rb can allow cells to enter the cell division cycle inappropriately.

**Rb and Cancer**

Although Rb was identified in a rare childhood cancer, it is also involved in some of the more common tumors of adults. In particular, studies of the cloned gene have established that Rb is lost or inactivated in many bladder, breast, and lung carcinomas. The significance of the Rb tumor suppressor gene thus extends beyond retinoblastoma, apparently contributing to development of a substantial fraction of more common human cancers.

In sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, both normal RB alleles must undergo a somatic mutation in the same cell. The probability of this is low, which explains why retinoblastoma is uncommon in the general population.

## 9.5 Oncogenes and Cell Cycle Dysregulation

### 9.5.1 Proto-oncogenes and Oncogenes

Cancer-critical genes are grouped into two broad classes, according to whether the cancer risk arises from too much activity of the gene product, or too little. Genes of the first class, for which a gain-of-function mutation drives a cell toward cancer, are called proto-oncogenes; their mutant, overactive forms are called oncogenes.

The activation of oncogenes involves genetic changes to cellular protooncogenes. The consequence of these genetic alterations is to confer a growth advantage to the cell. Three genetic mechanisms activate oncogenes in human neoplasms: (1) mutation, (2) gene amplification, and (3) chromosome rearrangements.

Cancer may also arise from proto-oncogenic genes, which then mutate to become oncogenic or tumor-promoting genes.

### 9.5.2 Mechanisms of Oncogene Activation

**Gene Amplification**

Gene amplification refers to the expansion in copy number of a gene within the genome of a cell. Gene amplification was first discovered as a mechanism by which some tumor cell lines can acquire resistance to growth-inhibiting drugs. About 20% to 30% of breast and ovarian cancers show c-myc amplification, and an approximately equal frequency of c-myc amplification is found in some types of squamous cell carcinomas.

**Chromosomal Rearrangements and Mutations**

N-myc was discovered as a new member of the myc protooncogene family through its amplification in neuroblastomas. Amplification of N-myc correlates strongly with advanced tumor stage in neuroblastoma, suggesting a role for this gene in tumor progression. L-myc was discovered through its amplification in small-cell carcinoma of the lung, a neuroendocrine-derived tumor.

### 9.5.3 Growth Factor Signaling and Cell Cycle

Mitogens act to release the brakes on Cdk activity, thereby allowing S phase to begin. They do so by binding to cell-surface receptors to initiate a complex array of intracellular signals that penetrate deep into the cytoplasm and nucleus. The ultimate result is the activation of G1-Cdk and G1/S-Cdk complexes, which overcome the inhibitory barriers that normally block progression into S phase.

Growth factors stimulate animal cell proliferation by inducing synthesis of the D-type cyclins.

**Oncogenic Stress Response**

Surprisingly, however, when Ras or Myc is experimentally hyperactivated in most normal cells, the result is not excessive proliferation but the opposite: the activation of checkpoint mechanisms causes the cells to undergo either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. The normal cell seems able to detect abnormal mitogenic stimulation, and it responds by preventing further division.

## 9.6 Disruption of Cell Cycle Control in Cancer

### 9.6.1 Common Alterations in Cancer

When either of these proteins is not functioning correctly, downstream elements are not properly functioning, such as the INK4a/ARF, which encodes for tumor suppressor proteins. However, tumors may grow, leading to cancer in these specific cells. Overexpression of growth factors or a lack of suppressor proteins can lead to rapid uncontrolled cell division.

Loss of p53 prevents this damage-induced cell cycle arrest, leading to increased mutation frequencies and a general instability of the cell genome. Such genetic instability is a common property of cancer cells, and it may contribute to further alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes during tumor progression.

**p53 Mutations in Cancer**

It is estimated that approximately one half of human cancers contain a mutation in p53. It is predicted that in the majority of the remaining tumors, the p53 signaling pathway is inactivated by up-regulation of p53 inhibitors, such as Mdm2, or by down-regulation of p53 cooperators, such as ARF.

In total, mutations of p53 may play a role in up to 50% of all cancers, making it the most common target of genetic alterations in human malignancies.

### 9.6.2 Viral Oncoproteins and Cell Cycle Control

In addition, as noted earlier in this chapter, the Rb protein is a key target for the oncogene proteins of several DNA tumor viruses, including SV40, adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses, which bind to Rb and inhibit its activity. Transformation by these viruses thus results, at least in part, from inactivation of Rb at the protein level rather than from mutational inactivation of the Rb gene.

DNA viruses such as papillomaviruses can promote the development of cancer by sequestering the products of tumor suppressor genes—in particular, the Rb protein, which regulates cell division, and the p53 protein, which is thought to act as an emergency brake on cell division in cells that have suffered genetic damage and to call a halt to cell division in senescent cells with shortened telomeres.

In papillomaviruses, the viral genes that are mainly to blame are called E6 and E7. The products of these viral oncogenes interact with many host cell proteins, but in particular they bind to the protein products of two key tumor suppressor genes of the host cell, putting them out of action and so permitting the cell to replicate its DNA and divide in an uncontrolled way.

### 9.6.3 Multistep Carcinogenesis

From genetic analysis of those samples, they concluded that mutational activation of oncogenes and mutational inactivation of tumor suppressor genes drive progression. Fewer genetic changes in key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes lead to benign tumors; more changes lead to aggressive cancers. The mutations tend to happen in a certain order, but much variability occurs. Five or so key mutations seem to be involved in progression.

Chronic exposures to carcinogens, accumulation of mutations, development of the mutator phenotype, and clonal selection during several decades result in cancer. Although the phenotypic traits of individual cancers are highly variable, commonly acquired capabilities include limitless replicative potential, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evading apoptosis, tissue invasion, sustained angiogenesis, and metastasis.

### 9.6.4 Consequences of Cell Cycle Disruption

**Genomic Instability**

Loss of p53 function leads to genomic instability, abnormal centrosome duplication, and formation of aneuploid and polyploid cells. This suggests that p53 plays a role in the control of centrosome duplication and normal chromosomal segregation.

**Unlimited Proliferative Potential**

As cells proliferate without regulation, tumors occur that can become deadly if not treated. Mitosis occurs infinitely. The cells never die in cancer, as cancer cells can utilize telomerase to add many telomeric sections to the ends of DNA during DNA replication, allowing the cells to live much longer than other somatic cells.


## 9.7 Therapeutic Implications 

### 9.7.1 Targeting Cell Cycle Checkpoints 

Furthermore, and of particular interest with regard to cancer treatment, are data from models suggesting that some tumor cells lacking p53 function are less sensitive to γ-irradiation and some chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin. Nevertheless, studies of other tumor cells suggest that p53 status shows a very different relationship to chemotherapeutic response, with cells that lack functional p53 being markedly sensitive to DNA-damaging agents but resistant to 5-fluorouracil.

**Enhanced Understanding of Checkpoint Targeting:**

The concept of targeting defective cell cycle checkpoints represents a paradigm shift from traditional cancer therapy approaches. Since cancer cells commonly harbor checkpoint defects that contributed to their neoplastic transformation, these defects can be exploited therapeutically through synthetic lethal approaches.

**Checkpoint Defects as Therapeutic Targets:**

Cell cycle checkpoints operate as safeguard mechanisms that ensure fidelity of cell division by detecting and responding to cellular stress or incomplete cellular processes. Cancer cells frequently have defective checkpoints, which paradoxically creates therapeutic opportunities:

**DNA Damage Checkpoints**: Cancer cells with p53 mutations (found in approximately 50% of human cancers) have compromised G1/S checkpoints. These cells become more reliant on other checkpoint mechanisms, particularly the G2/M checkpoint controlled by Chk1 kinase. Chk1 inhibitors can force p53-deficient cancer cells to bypass G2 arrest and enter mitosis with unrepaired DNA damage, leading to mitotic catastrophe.

**Replication Checkpoints**: ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) inhibitors target the replication checkpoint that responds to replication fork stalling. When combined with DNA-damaging agents like platinum compounds or topoisomerase inhibitors, ATR inhibitors prevent proper checkpoint arrest, forcing cells into mitosis with incompletely replicated DNA.

**Spindle Assembly Checkpoint**: The spindle checkpoint ensures proper chromosome attachment before anaphase. While targeting this checkpoint directly is challenging due to its importance in normal cells, specific vulnerabilities in cancer cells with chromosomal instability are being explored.

**Wee1 Kinase Targeting**: Wee1 inhibitors like MK-1775 (Adavosertib) prevent G2/M checkpoint arrest by blocking the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1. This forces DNA-damaged cells into premature mitosis, leading to mitotic catastrophe particularly in p53-deficient tumors.

**Clinical Applications:**

Several checkpoint inhibitors have entered clinical trials:
- **UCN-01**: An early pan-checkpoint kinase inhibitor that showed limited success due to non-selectivity
- **AZD7762**: A Chk1/2 inhibitor tested in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy
- **Prexasertib**: A selective Chk1 inhibitor showing promise in p53-deficient tumors

### 9.7.2 CDK Inhibitors as Cancer Therapeutics 

Control of Cdk inhibitors thus provides an additional mechanism for regulating Cdk activity. The combined effects of these multiple modes of Cdk regulation are responsible for controlling cell cycle progression in response both to checkpoint controls and to the variety of extracellular stimuli that regulate cell proliferation.

Understanding the mechanisms of cell cycle control and their disruption in cancer provides important insights for developing targeted cancer therapies. The identification of specific vulnerabilities in cancer cells with defective checkpoints offers opportunities for selective therapeutic intervention.

**Enhanced CDK Inhibitor Development:**

The development of CDK inhibitors has progressed through three distinct generations, each with improved selectivity and therapeutic efficacy:

**First Generation - Pan-CDK Inhibitors:**
- **Flavopiridol (Alvocidib)**: The pioneer CDK inhibitor that targets multiple CDKs but showed limited clinical success due to poor selectivity and significant toxicity
- **Roscovitine**: A purine-based inhibitor that demonstrated activity in preclinical models but failed to show significant improvement in Phase II trials

**Second Generation - Improved Selectivity:**
- **Dinaciclib (SCH727965)**: Primarily inhibits CDK9, preventing RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and inducing apoptosis. Currently in Phase III trials showing impressive anti-tumor activity in hematological malignancies
- **P276-00**: Shows selectivity for CDK4, CDK1, and CDK9
- **AT7519**: Targets CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, and CDK9 with improved therapeutic window
- **Roniciclib**: Designed with better pharmacokinetic properties

**Third Generation - Highly Selective CDK4/6 Inhibitors:**

The breakthrough in CDK inhibitor therapy came with highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitors that revolutionized breast cancer treatment:

**Approved CDK4/6 Inhibitors:**
- **Palbociclib (Ibrance)**: First approved CDK4/6 inhibitor, showing equivalent inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6
- **Ribociclib (Kisqali)**: Structurally similar to palbociclib with comparable efficacy
- **Abemaciclib (Verzenio)**: More potent against CDK4 than CDK6, with unique pharmacological properties allowing continuous dosing

**Clinical Success in Breast Cancer:**

CDK4/6 inhibitors have transformed the treatment landscape for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer:

**Pivotal Clinical Trials:**
- **PALOMA Studies**: Demonstrated significant progression-free survival benefit when palbociclib was combined with letrozole or fulvestrant
- **MONALEESA Trials**: Proved ribociclib's efficacy in combination with various endocrine therapies
- **MONARCH Studies**: Established abemaciclib's effectiveness both in combination and as monotherapy

**Mechanisms of Action Beyond Cell Cycle:**
Recent research reveals CDK4/6 inhibitors work through multiple mechanisms:
- **Enhancing Cytostasis**: Amplifying growth inhibitory signals from targeted therapies
- **Inducing Senescence**: Promoting permanent cell cycle exit
- **Metabolic Regulation**: Altering cellular energy metabolism
- **Immune System Enhancement**: Promoting anti-tumor immune responses through various mechanisms including enhanced antigen presentation

**Resistance Mechanisms and Next-Generation Approaches:**

Understanding resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors has led to new therapeutic strategies:

**Primary Resistance Mechanisms:**
- **CDK2 Activation**: Aberrant activation of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes bypasses CDK4/6 dependence
- **Rb Loss**: Loss of the primary CDK4/6 target eliminates inhibitor effectiveness
- **Cyclin D1 Amplification**: Overexpression overcomes inhibitor binding
- **p16 Loss**: Eliminates endogenous CDK4/6 inhibition

**Emerging CDK Targets:**

**CDK2 Inhibitors**: With recognition of CDK2 as a key resistance mechanism, selective CDK2 inhibitors are in development:
- **CYC065**: Selective CDK2 inhibitor showing promise in preclinical studies
- **SY-5609**: CDK7 inhibitor that indirectly affects CDK2 activation

## Conclusion

The cell cycle control system represents one of the most fundamental regulatory networks in biology. Each of the different cyclin-Cdk complexes serves as a molecular switch that triggers a specific cell-cycle event. We now consider how these switches initiate such events and how the cell-cycle control system ensures that the switches fire in the correct order and only once per cell cycle.

The variety of ways in which the machinery of cell-cycle control can be altered in cancer illustrates two important points. First, it explains why individual cases of a particular cancer showing the same symptoms may arise from different mutations: in many cases several alternative mutations will have much the same effect on cell proliferation. Second, it reinforces the point that there is no fundamental difference in the processes that are affected by oncogenes—which become activated by mutation—and those affected by tumor suppressor genes—which become inactivated.

The intricate balance between positive and negative regulators of cell cycle progression ensures that cell division occurs only when appropriate. Disruption of this balance through mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leads to the uncontrolled proliferation characteristic of cancer. Understanding these mechanisms continues to provide new opportunities for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

As our knowledge of cell cycle control mechanisms expands, particularly regarding the molecular details of checkpoint signaling and the role of epigenetic modifications, new therapeutic targets and strategies will undoubtedly emerge. The challenge lies in translating this fundamental understanding into effective clinical interventions that can selectively target cancer cells while preserving normal cellular function.
