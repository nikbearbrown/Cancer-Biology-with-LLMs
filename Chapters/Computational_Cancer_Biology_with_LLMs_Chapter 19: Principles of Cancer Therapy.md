# Chapter 19: Principles of Cancer Therapy

Cancer therapy has evolved from crude surgical interventions to sophisticated, molecularly-targeted treatments that offer unprecedented precision in attacking malignant cells while sparing normal tissues. This transformation reflects our growing understanding of cancer biology and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Understanding the fundamental principles that guide cancer treatment decisions is essential for healthcare professionals involved in cancer care, as these principles inform treatment selection, sequencing, and integration of multiple therapeutic modalities.

## 19.1 Goals of Cancer Treatment

The primary goal of cancer therapy varies significantly based on the stage of disease, tumor characteristics, patient factors, and available therapeutic options. Understanding these goals is fundamental to making appropriate treatment decisions and setting realistic expectations for patients and families.

### 19.1.1 Curative Treatment

**Definition and Objectives:**
Cancer treatment is the series of interventions, including psychosocial support, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, that is aimed at curing the disease or prolonging the patient's life considerably (for several years) while improving the patient's quality of life.

**Characteristics of Curative Care:**
Cure is defined as the attainment of normal life expectancy and has three important components: recovery from all evidence of disease (complete remission); attainment of a stage of minimal or no risk of recurrence or relapse; restoration of functional health (physical, developmental and psychosocial).

**Curable Cancers:**
Curable cancers are cancers for which treatment can give patients a high potential for being disease free in the 10 years following cessation of treatment. These typically include:
- Early-stage solid tumors amenable to complete surgical resection
- Localized cancers responsive to radiation therapy
- Hematologic malignancies responsive to chemotherapy
- Certain pediatric cancers with high cure rates

**Treatment Approaches for Curative Intent:**
- **Surgery:** Complete resection of the primary tumor with adequate margins
- **Radiation therapy:** High-dose radiation to eradicate localized disease
- **Systemic therapy:** Chemotherapy or targeted therapy to eliminate micrometastatic disease
- **Multimodal therapy:** Combination of treatment modalities to maximize cure probability

### 19.1.2 Life-Prolonging Treatment

**Rationale and Application:**
When cure is not achievable, the focus shifts to prolonging survival while maintaining quality of life. This approach is appropriate for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease where complete eradication is not possible but meaningful disease control can be achieved.

**Treatment Strategies:**
- **Disease stabilization:** Preventing tumor progression for extended periods
- **Tumor response:** Achieving partial or complete responses to extend survival
- **Metastatic control:** Managing disseminated disease to prolong life
- **Combination approaches:** Sequential or concurrent use of multiple therapies

**Success Metrics:**
- **Overall survival:** Extension of life expectancy beyond natural history
- **Progression-free survival:** Time to disease progression or death
- **Time to treatment failure:** Duration of benefit from specific therapies
- **Quality-adjusted survival:** Meaningful life extension with acceptable toxicity

### 19.1.3 Palliative Treatment

**Fundamental Principles:**
The World Health Organization characterizes the field of palliative care as a form of specialized medical care that aims to optimize the quality of life and alleviate the suffering of patients. The goal of palliative care is to improve the quality of life of patients who have a serious or life-threatening disease.

**WHO Definition:**
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines palliative care in cancer as the "active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment." The definition is extended in an important way with the statement, "Many aspects of palliative care are also applicable earlier in the course of the illness, in conjunction with anticancer treatment."

**Key Components of Palliative Care:**
- **Symptom management:** Control of pain, nausea, dyspnea, fatigue, and other distressing symptoms
- **Psychosocial support:** Addressing emotional, social, and spiritual needs
- **Quality of life optimization:** Maintaining function and comfort
- **Family support:** Caring for caregivers and loved ones
- **End-of-life care:** Ensuring comfort and dignity during dying process

**Total Pain Concept:**
Dame Cicely Saunders, considered the founder of both the modern hospice movement and the field of PC, developed and propagated the clinical practice around her concept of "Total Pain." Total Pain refers to the comprehensive, multifaceted experience of suffering associated with serious illness, which Saunders further divided into four domains: physical, emotional, social, and spiritual.

### 19.1.4 Preventive and Supportive Treatment

**Preventive Interventions:**
- **Adjuvant therapy:** Treatment given after primary therapy to eliminate residual disease
- **Neoadjuvant therapy:** Treatment given before primary therapy to improve outcomes
- **Prophylactic therapy:** Prevention of complications or secondary malignancies

**Supportive Care Integration:**
Supportive care is the multidisciplinary holistic care offered to all patients and their carers throughout the pathway to help them cope with cancer and treatment of it. It includes issues such as information giving, symptom control and psychological, social and spiritual support.

### 19.1.5 Goal Setting and Communication

**Importance of Clear Goals:**
Patients and oncologists frequently do not share an understanding of the goals of cancer treatment. One group of researchers reported that in 25% of the advanced-cancer patient–physician dyads surveyed, the patient thought the goal of care was to cure disease when it was not.

**Effective Goal Communication:**
- **Honest prognostic discussions:** Sharing realistic expectations about outcomes
- **Shared decision-making:** Involving patients in treatment goal determination
- **Regular reassessment:** Adapting goals as disease status changes
- **Family involvement:** Including loved ones in goal-setting conversations

## 19.2 Multidisciplinary Approach to Cancer Care

Modern cancer care requires coordination among multiple specialists and healthcare professionals to deliver optimal outcomes. The complexity of cancer treatment necessitates expertise from various disciplines working in concert to address all aspects of patient care.

### 19.2.1 Principles of Multidisciplinary Care

**Fundamental Philosophy:**
Most cancer patients, and society in general, would like to think that the entire team of doctors, nurses, and specialists are cooperatively involved in solving their medical problems. The keystone for a successful interdisciplinary management team is attitude: humility, tolerance, adaptability, and appreciation for alternative approaches.

**Team Interdependence:**
None of us is so skilled that he or she can be as expert in every discipline as a highly competent exponent of that particular specialty. No one is omniscient. We are, and must be, interdependent, so it is important to work with individuals who are trustworthy and friendly.

**Benefits of Multidisciplinary Care:**
- **Comprehensive expertise:** Access to specialized knowledge across disciplines
- **Coordinated treatment planning:** Integration of multiple therapeutic modalities
- **Quality improvement:** Enhanced decision-making through collective input
- **Patient advocacy:** Multiple perspectives ensuring optimal patient care

### 19.2.2 Core Team Members

#### Medical Oncology

**Role and Responsibilities:**
Medical oncologists provide expertise in systemic therapies including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy. They often serve as the primary coordinator of care for cancer patients throughout the treatment continuum.

**Key Functions:**
- **Treatment planning:** Selection of appropriate systemic therapies
- **Toxicity management:** Monitoring and managing treatment-related side effects
- **Disease monitoring:** Assessing treatment response and disease progression
- **Supportive care:** Coordinating symptom management and quality of life interventions

#### Surgical Oncology

**Fundamental Role:**
Surgery is the oldest modality of cancer therapy and still forms the mainstay of treatment in solid tumors. It remains a paradigm that more patients are cured by surgery when it is used as a single treatment in comparison with any other individual form of cancer therapy.

**Surgical Oncologist Responsibilities:**
The cancer surgeon is commonly charged with the responsibility to establish a tissue diagnosis for a suspicious lesion... The cancer surgeon will usually bear the responsibility for communicating the biopsy findings to the patient, completing the procedures needed to stage the patient's disease, and planning and executing the definitive surgical treatment.

**Evolving Surgical Approaches:**
During the past two decades, major improvements in both operative technique and the use of combined modality therapy have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with the surgical treatment of solid neoplasms.

#### Radiation Oncology

**Treatment Applications:**
Radiation therapy serves multiple roles in cancer care, from definitive treatment of localized disease to palliative management of symptoms. Radiation oncologists work closely with other team members to integrate radiation therapy into comprehensive treatment plans.

**Clinical Applications:**
- **Curative radiation:** High-dose treatment for localized cancers
- **Adjuvant radiation:** Post-operative treatment to reduce recurrence risk
- **Neoadjuvant radiation:** Pre-operative treatment to improve surgical outcomes
- **Palliative radiation:** Symptom relief in advanced disease

#### Pathology

**Diagnostic Foundation:**
Pathologists are physicians who are concerned primarily with the study of disease in all its aspects; that is, causation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, mechanisms, natural history, anatomic and biochemical features, progression, and prognosis.

**Critical Role in Treatment Planning:**
Pathological diagnosis provides the foundation for all cancer treatment decisions, including histologic type, grade, stage, and molecular characteristics that guide therapy selection.

### 19.2.3 Supportive Care Specialists

#### Palliative Care Team

**Team Composition:**
A palliative team is comprised of a wide array of professionals, including the palliative physician, nurse, social worker, chaplain, and pharmacist.

**Palliative Care Integration:**
Palliative care is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness and is provided along with curative treatment. Thus, the provision of PC is based on the needs of the patient, not on the patient's prognosis.

#### Rehabilitation Team

**Cancer Rehabilitation Goals:**
Cancer rehabilitation can be broadly defined as the maximum restoration of physical, psychologic, social, vocational, recreational, and economic functions within the limits imposed by the malignancy and its treatment.

**Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation Team:**
An integral part of such programs is an interdisciplinary cancer rehabilitation and adaptation team... The team is led by a physician who is either an oncologist or, more commonly, a physiatrist. An oncology nurse, social worker, psychologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, vocational counselor, chaplain, and nutritionist are present on most teams.

### 19.2.4 Communication and Coordination

#### Tumor Boards and Multidisciplinary Conferences

**Function and Impact:**
A tumor conference occasionally alters the primary oncologist's opinions and plans and, thus, the therapeutic approach for a specific patient. A conference may surface unfamiliar data, with references, that can change the course. The most important contribution of a conference, however, is the establishment of dialogue, which impacts on the future disposition of similar clinical problems.

**Benefits of Multidisciplinary Review:**
- **Collective expertise:** Input from multiple specialists
- **Treatment optimization:** Refinement of therapeutic plans
- **Quality assurance:** Peer review of treatment decisions
- **Education:** Learning opportunities for team members

#### Care Coordination

**Integrated Treatment Planning:**
Because surgery is increasingly combined with other treatment modalities, it is essential that most patients with solid neoplasms have their treatment planned by a multidisciplinary team, which includes radiation and medical oncologists as well as surgical oncologists.

**Sequential vs. Concurrent Care:**
A second oncologic specialist of a different discipline, whose encounter with the patient occurs after the first oncologist has already changed the tumor and the patient, may rightly point out a better approach for the future. A medical oncologist or radiation oncologist can better know and eventually better treat a patient who has been seen before definitive surgical treatment rather than after.

### 19.2.5 Challenges in Multidisciplinary Care

#### Resource and Access Issues

**Workforce Considerations:**
People living with and beyond cancer require multidisciplinary, multispecialty care to address a broad range of health care needs—from monitoring for cancer recurrence to detecting and managing toxicities to addressing psychosocial challenges—that affect their health and well-being throughout their lives.

**Access Barriers:**
However, many people face significant barriers in accessing the specialized medical expertise they need, navigating systems of referrals and payments, and receiving care that is appropriately comprehensive and coordinated.

#### Team Dynamics

**Interpersonal Challenges:**
More failures of interdisciplinary management teams seem to occur because of personality conflicts than because of intellectual disagreements. In the heat of confrontational oratory, emotional preferences may win out over reasoned accord.

**Quality Improvement:**
Happily, the energies they squander in picayune or counterproductive activities are small compared to their constructive, positive efforts to seek improved (not just new) approaches to cancer.

## 19.3 Personalized Medicine: Tailoring Treatment to the Individual

The evolution toward personalized medicine represents a fundamental shift from treating cancer based solely on anatomical site and histology to incorporating molecular characteristics, patient factors, and individual preferences into treatment decisions.

### 19.3.1 Foundations of Personalized Medicine

**Conceptual Framework:**
Every patient is unique, and the evolving field of precision medicine aims to ensure the delivery of the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. Treatment previously based on the anatomic origin of cancer (e.g., lung, breast, colon, prostate) is being expanded to include the use of genomic tests to stratify patients into subsets based on the specific molecular drivers of their individual tumors.

**Precision Medicine Definition:**
The vision for a New Taxonomy informed by the proposed "Knowledge Network" shares some similarities with the widely discussed concept of "Personalized Medicine," recently defined by the President's Council on Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) as "the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient... to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment."

### 19.3.2 Molecular Profiling and Targeted Therapy

#### Genomic Medicine Implementation

**Clinical Applications:**
Oncology has been at the forefront of advances in precision medicine, primarily due to the genomic nature of cancer: "Most cancers harbor a cocktail of mutated (or otherwise altered) oncogenes and tumor suppressors that work in concert to specify the molecular pathways that lead to their genesis, maintenance, and progression."

**Actionable Alterations:**
For several major tumor types, including melanoma and breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and brain cancers, about half of those tumors harbor at least one identifiable genetic alteration that fosters tumor growth or survival and is "actionable." An actionable alteration is one that can be targeted by approved or experimental drugs, or one that suggests the inappropriateness of treatment using certain approaches.

#### Biomarker-Driven Treatment Selection

**Treatment Matching:**
This is one of the largest ever personalised medicine trials in any cancer, one which attempts to match the right treatment to the right patient based on an in-depth understanding of what makes their own cancer cells grow and survive.

**Clinical Implementation:**
- **Companion diagnostics:** Tests that identify patients likely to benefit from specific therapies
- **Tumor sequencing:** Comprehensive genomic profiling to identify therapeutic targets
- **Liquid biopsies:** Non-invasive monitoring of tumor evolution and treatment response
- **Molecular tumor boards:** Expert review of genomic findings for treatment recommendations

### 19.3.3 Patient-Specific Factors

#### Individual Risk Assessment

**Multifactorial Considerations:**
Personalized treatment decisions must integrate tumor characteristics with patient-specific factors including:
- **Performance status:** Functional capacity and ability to tolerate treatment
- **Comorbidities:** Concurrent medical conditions affecting treatment selection
- **Age and life expectancy:** Balancing treatment benefits with remaining lifespan
- **Previous treatments:** Prior therapy history and resistance patterns

#### Treatment Tolerance and Toxicity Prediction

**Pharmacogenomics:**
Understanding individual variations in drug metabolism and response enables optimization of dosing and selection of therapies with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity.

**Predictive Factors:**
- **Genetic polymorphisms:** Variations affecting drug metabolism
- **Organ function:** Kidney, liver, and cardiac status
- **Drug interactions:** Concurrent medications and supplements
- **Nutritional status:** Impact on treatment tolerance and outcomes

### 19.3.4 Adaptive Treatment Strategies

#### Dynamic Treatment Planning

**Tumor Evolution Recognition:**
The continuous biological changes in the neoplastic cell population represent an essential characteristic of each neoplasm, with infinite possibilities of transformation. The heterogeneity of neoplastic cells is a property that is amplified with the evolution of cancer disease.

**Response-Adapted Therapy:**
- **Early response assessment:** Modification of treatment based on initial response
- **Resistance monitoring:** Detection of acquired resistance mechanisms
- **Sequential therapy:** Planned treatment sequences based on expected resistance patterns
- **Combination strategies:** Rational drug combinations to prevent resistance

#### Precision Medicine Clinical Trials

**Innovative Trial Designs:**
Presented by the trial website as 'the largest precision medicine trial in non-small cell lung cancer globally', Matrix involves a rolling programme of recruitment to treatment arms which can close and open as knowledge about the effectiveness of drugs develops through the research.

**Adaptive Trials:**
- **Master protocols:** Single trials testing multiple targeted agents
- **Umbrella trials:** Multiple substudies within a single cancer type
- **Basket trials:** Single targeted therapy across multiple cancer types
- **Platform trials:** Perpetual trials with adding and dropping of arms

### 19.3.5 Challenges and Future Directions

#### Implementation Challenges

**Economic Considerations:**
Recent reports suggest that in one of the largest markets, the USA, spending on cancer drugs in the genomic era has increased dramatically – rising from $26 billion in 2012 to more than $45 billion in 2016, with targeted therapies accounting for 60 per cent of this increase.

**Access and Equity:**
- **Cost barriers:** High prices of personalized therapies
- **Geographic disparities:** Unequal access to molecular testing and targeted therapies
- **Health system capacity:** Infrastructure requirements for precision medicine
- **Insurance coverage:** Reimbursement challenges for novel diagnostics and therapies

#### Scientific Limitations

**Clinical Efficacy Questions:**
The promise of personalised or precision medicine for cancer is contested in medicine, science and beyond in the public sphere because of concerns about efficacy and cost in particular... overall survival from 71 targeted cancer therapies approved by the FDA between 2002 and 2014 was only 2.1 months.

**Complexity Challenges:**
The consequences of heterogeneity, clonal evolution and the influence of the host response are that simple genetic tests are much less accurate in predicting prognosis and treatment response than was expected based on the CML imatinib paradigm.

### 19.3.6 Future Directions

#### Emerging Technologies

**Artificial Intelligence Integration:**
- **Pattern recognition:** Machine learning for treatment response prediction
- **Drug discovery:** AI-driven identification of novel therapeutic targets
- **Clinical decision support:** Algorithmic assistance in treatment selection
- **Outcome prediction:** Predictive modeling for personalized prognosis

#### Expanding Precision Medicine

**Broader Applications:**
The tailoring of treatment to specific molecular targets is being applied to other diseases and conditions, including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

**Comprehensive Profiling:**
- **Multi-omics integration:** Combining genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data
- **Microenvironment analysis:** Understanding tumor-immune interactions
- **Pharmacokinetic modeling:** Personalized dosing strategies
- **Quality of life metrics:** Individual optimization of treatment tolerability

## Conclusion

The principles of cancer therapy continue to evolve as our understanding of cancer biology deepens and new therapeutic modalities emerge. The fundamental goals of treatment—cure, life prolongation, and palliation—remain constant, but the methods to achieve these goals have become increasingly sophisticated and personalized.

**Key Clinical Takeaways:**

1. **Goal-Oriented Treatment:** Clear communication about treatment goals ensures alignment between patients, families, and healthcare teams, facilitating appropriate treatment selection and realistic expectations.

2. **Multidisciplinary Integration:** Optimal cancer outcomes require coordinated care from multiple specialists working together to address all aspects of the patient's needs throughout the cancer continuum.

3. **Personalized Approaches:** The future of cancer therapy lies in tailoring treatment to individual patient and tumor characteristics, moving beyond one-size-fits-all approaches to precision medicine.

4. **Palliative Care Integration:** Palliative care should be considered early in the cancer journey, complementing rather than replacing curative treatments, to optimize quality of life and symptom management.

5. **Adaptive Strategies:** Treatment plans must remain flexible and responsive to changing clinical circumstances, tumor evolution, and patient preferences throughout the course of care.

6. **Communication Excellence:** Effective communication about goals, prognosis, and treatment options is fundamental to delivering patient-centered cancer care that respects individual values and preferences.

The successful implementation of these principles requires ongoing collaboration among healthcare professionals, continued investment in research and development, and commitment to addressing access and equity challenges that prevent all patients from benefiting from advances in cancer therapy. As precision medicine continues to evolve, the focus must remain on delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time while maintaining the human elements of compassion, communication, and comprehensive care that define excellent oncology practice.
