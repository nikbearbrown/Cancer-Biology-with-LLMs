# Chapter 11: Cancer Metabolism: The Warburg Effect and Beyond

## Introduction

The fundamental abnormality resulting in the development of cancer is the continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body.

For decades, there has been growing evidence of a relationship between metabolism and malignant cell proliferation. Unlike normal differentiated cells, cancer cells have reprogrammed metabolism in order to fulfill their energy requirements. These cells display crucial modifications in many metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and glutaminolysis, which include the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the electron transport chain (ETC), and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).

Cancer cells need not only a genetic switch but also metabolic building blocks and energy sources to undergo rapid proliferation. This metabolic reprogramming represents one of the emerging hallmarks of cancer and provides both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

## 11.1 The Warburg Effect: Historical Discovery and Modern Understanding

### 11.1.1 Historical Perspective

Otto Warburg observed a peculiar phenomenon in 1924, unknowingly laying the foundation for the field of cancer metabolism. While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis, Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose.

In 1927, Warburg studied the processes of respiration and fermentation in tumor cells. According to normal cellular respiration, glucose is converted to pyruvate, which then enters the TCA cycle to undergo oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen, and there should be minimal lactate production. However, in his in vivo and ex vivo studies, Warburg observed an increased glucose uptake and increased lactic acid production in tumor cells as compared to normal cells, even in the presence of oxygen.

This phenomenon, the metabolism of glucose to lactate despite the presence of adequate oxygen, is called the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis. For Warburg, several questions remained unanswered, including why cancer cells would inefficiently shunt glucose-derived pyruvate to lactate production instead of to the TCA cycle, which would result in significantly higher ATP production.

### 11.1.2 Contemporary Understanding

**Efficiency and Kinetics**

Given the inefficiency of ATP production in the Warburg effect, there are likely differences in the kinetics of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which have led to cancer cells promoting aerobic glycolysis. Demetrios et al. found that, in the Warburg effect, the flux of glucose to lactate is up to 100 times faster than through the TCA cycle resulting in similar amounts of ATP production over the same time. Even when oxidative phosphorylation is actively continuing, aerobic glycolysis will see much higher glucose flux.

**Anabolic Requirements**

To further understand a cancer cell's dependence on aerobic glycolysis, it is necessary to revisit one of the hallmarks of cancer—rapid proliferation supported by strong anabolism. Tumor cells need not only ATP but also anabolic metabolism to accumulate a large amount of biomass to sustain their growth.

**Clinical Applications**

PET is an exploitation of the high rate of glycolysis in cancer cells as it uses a radiolabeled glucose analog, [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG), which accumulates in tumor cells due to their rapid uptake of glucose. Another developing application of the Warburg effect is the use of gene expression profiles linked to glycolysis to determine prognosis. Tools in both lung adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer have shown that glycolytic phenotypes are generally associated with worse patient survival.

### 11.1.3 Metabolic Heterogeneity

For a long time, it was believed that cancer cells' major metabolic footprint was the Warburg effect, which dictates that cancer cells undergo glycolysis to produce lactic acid even in the presence of oxygen, a process termed aerobic glycolysis. Although the Warburg effect is still relevant, it has recently become clear that the metabolic phenotypes of cancer cells are far more varied and intricate.

In a recent study published by Le et al., the identification of genetic variability within the same tumor also revealed distinct metabolic profiles of each cell subpopulation within a given tumor. In addition to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) positive and/or cycling cells (Warburg effect-displaying cells), they found that the subpopulation that was HIF negative and non-cycling expressed a distinct set of genes with increased expression of mitochondrial genes as compared to other subpopulations.

## 11.2 Glucose Metabolism in Cancer

### 11.2.1 Glycolytic Pathway Regulation

**Basic Glycolysis Pathway**

Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway and an anaerobic energy source that has evolved in nearly all types of organisms. The process entails the oxidation of glucose molecules, the single most crucial organic fuel in plants, microbes, and animals. In glycolysis, 2 ATP molecules are consumed, producing 4 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvates per glucose molecule.

Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of the cell. It is a metabolic pathway that creates ATP without the use of oxygen but can occur in the presence of oxygen. In cells that use aerobic respiration as the primary energy source, the pyruvate formed from the pathway can be used in the citric acid cycle and go through oxidative phosphorylation to undergo oxidation into carbon dioxide and water.

**Enhanced Glycolysis in Cancer**

Tumor cells exhibit an upregulation in glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, and gluconeogenesis as opposed to normal cells. Several oncogenes and tumor suppressors drive the metabolic reprogramming underlying the Warburg effect and other changes in glucose metabolism.

The amount of glucose available for the process regulates glycolysis, which becomes available primarily in two ways: regulation of glucose reuptake or regulation of the breakdown of glycogen. As described before, many enzymes are involved in the glycolytic pathway by converting one intermediate to another. Control of these enzymes, such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase, is crucial for cancer metabolism.

### 11.2.2 The Reverse Warburg Effect

The Warburg effect, a phenomenon initially believed to be limited to cancer cells, has also been observed in the fibroblasts surrounding the cancer cells. To distinguish this CAF-related phenomenon from its cancer cell-related counterpart, Pavlides et al. named it the reverse Warburg effect.

Subsequently, HIF-1, a regulator of all glycolytic enzymes, as well as glucose transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT3, induces aerobic glycolysis. A similar study performed by Shan et al. provided further evidence to support the reverse Warburg effect hypothesis. In this study, pancreatic associated fibroblasts expressed elevated levels of the glycolytic enzymes LDHA and PKM2, as well as the MCT4 transporter responsible for lactate secretion.

Additionally, they observed that when pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to CAF-conditioned media, they underwent enhanced aerobic activity, causing an observable enlargement of the mitochondria. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer cells significantly increased the expression of MCT1, fumarate hydratase (FH), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). The overexpression of these enzymes further indicated the existence of metabolic coupling between CAFs and cancer cells.

### 11.2.3 Therapeutic Targeting of Glucose Metabolism

Consequently, this has resulted in increased research addressing the production of commercial GLUT inhibitors and the transporter isoform specificity of inhibition. Other drugs have been developed to target the hypoxic pathways of cancer cells, such as topotecan, which inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcriptional activity and HIF-1α protein accumulation in hypoxia-treated U251 human glioma cells.

Many drugs have followed with variable success that act by blocking mRNA transcription of the HIF-1α gene. Recent research has also provided many other pathways in cancer metabolism that can be targeted with effective results. For example, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), an enzyme involved in the generation of lactate from glucose in Warburg effect-displaying cells, has also been found to be a suitable target for effective tumor reduction through small-molecule inhibition.

## 11.3 Mitochondrial Function in Cancer

### 11.3.1 Mitochondrial Structure and Function

Mitochondria play a critical role in the generation of metabolic energy in eukaryotic cells. They are responsible for most of the useful energy derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates and fatty acids, which is converted to ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation.

Mitochondria are surrounded by a double-membrane system, consisting of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes separated by an intermembrane space. The inner membrane is highly specialized. Its lipid bilayer contains a high proportion of the "double" phospholipid cardiolipin, which has four fatty acids rather than two and may help to make the membrane especially impermeable to ions.

### 11.3.2 Mitochondria in Cancer Metabolism

**Energy Production**

Without mitochondria, present-day animal cells would be dependent on anaerobic glycolysis for all of their ATP. When glucose is converted to pyruvate by glycolysis, only a very small fraction of the total free energy potentially available from the glucose is released. In mitochondria, the metabolism of sugars is completed: the pyruvate is imported into the mitochondrion and oxidized by O2 to CO2 and H2O. This allows 15 times more ATP to be made than that produced by glycolysis alone.

Mitochondria occupy a substantial portion of the cytoplasmic volume of eucaryotic cells, and they have been essential for the evolution of complex animals. Time-lapse microcinematography of living cells, however, shows that mitochondria are remarkably mobile and plastic organelles, constantly changing their shape and even fusing with one another and then separating again.

**Metabolic Integration**

The matrix enzymes include those that metabolize pyruvate and fatty acids to produce acetyl CoA and those that oxidize acetyl CoA in the citric acid cycle. The principal end-products of this oxidation are CO2, which is released from the cell as waste, and NADH, which is the main source of electrons for transport along the respiratory chain—the name given to the electron-transport chain in mitochondria.

Mitochondria can use both pyruvate and fatty acids as fuel. Pyruvate comes from glucose and other sugars, whereas fatty acids come from fats. Both of these fuel molecules are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane and then converted to the crucial metabolic intermediate acetyl CoA by enzymes located in the mitochondrial matrix.

### 11.3.3 Mitochondrial Protein Import and Assembly

Most mitochondrial proteins are translated on free cytosolic ribosomes and imported into the organelle by specific targeting signals. The assembly of mitochondria thus involves proteins encoded by their own genomes and translated within the organelle, as well as proteins encoded by the nuclear genome and imported from the cytosol.

The nucleus contains the genes that encode most of the mitochondrial proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation and all of the enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism (e.g., enzymes of the citric acid cycle). The proteins encoded by these genes (more than 95% of mitochondrial proteins) are synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria as completed polypeptide chains.

## 11.4 Lipid Metabolism in Cancer

### 11.4.1 Fatty Acid Synthesis and Cancer

**De Novo Lipid Synthesis**

Endogenous fatty acid synthesis is frequently upregulated in cancer because fatty acids can serve as substrates to produce lipid signaling molecules, modify protein functions through lipidation, synthesize phospholipids for cell membranes, or store energy as triglycerides. The primary source of carbons for fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells comes from glucose.

Glucose carbon is incorporated into acetyl-CoA, which then forms citrate in the mitochondria. The mitochondrial citrate transporter protein (CTP) carries citrate from the mitochondria to the cytosol. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis (DNLS), cleaves cytosolic citrate into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate.

**Enzyme Regulation**

ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is found to be elevated in many types of cancers, including breast, lung, liver, and bladder cancers. The Avantaggiati research group has extensively studied the mitochondrial citrate transporter protein (CTP) and demonstrated that CTP plays an important role in preventing mitochondrial damage and preserving its function, such as in cellular bioenergetics.

The inhibition of CTP resulted in anti-tumorigenesis in vivo. Although the authors observed a decrease in fatty acid synthesis from glucose due to the suppression of CTP-dependent transport of citrate by a benzene-tricarboxylate analog (BTA), they believe that this effect only played a partial role in tumor reduction because the total FA levels were not drastically affected.

### 11.4.2 Fatty Acid Oxidation

Mitochondria fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) involves the breakdown of energy-rich lipid molecules and plays a crucial role in the bioenergy metabolism exploited by cancer cells. The upregulation of FAO in cancer cells provides energy and metabolic flexibility.

The lipid metabolism dysregulation has been observed in both cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The alterations in FAO vary depending on the specific disease and the stage of the disease. The role of FAO is especially important, considering that it is the predominant pathway utilized by many cell types for energy production.

### 11.4.3 Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Lipid Metabolism

New research performed by Zhao et al. in 2020 has shown that CAFs overexpress FASN and undergo lipidomic reprogramming to help colorectal cancer cells meet their high energy demands by providing them with newly synthesized lipids. Nineteen lipids were specifically identified that were produced and secreted by CAFs and taken up by colorectal cancer cells.

Accumulation of fatty acids in the TME could serve as a nutrient reservoir for cancer cell growth during nutrient deprivation. Taken together, stromal catabolites, such as free fatty acids, promote tumor growth, and act as chemoattractants to metastasizing cancer cells.

## 11.5 Amino Acid Metabolism in Cancer

### 11.5.1 Glutamine Metabolism

**Glutamine as a Critical Nutrient**

Glutamine is one of the most abundant nonessential amino acids in the bloodstream (produced by the human body and thus not an essential part of the diet) and contributes to virtually every biosynthetic pathway in proliferating cells. Moreover, it acts as a nitrogen donor in purine and pyrimidine synthesis as well as a precursor for protein and glutathione biosynthesis.

Many tumor cells are reliant on exogenous glutamine and have been reported to die in its absence. Since glutamine-derived α-KG fuels the TCA cycle, cancer cells can employ glutaminolysis to sustain the biosynthesis of many essential molecules.

**Glutaminolysis Pathway**

Glutamate can be further catabolized through the TCA cycle (via conversion to α KG) or serve as a substrate for glutathione synthesis. α-KG formation can be catalyzed by either glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or aminotransferases. Alternatively, glutamate can be further converted to glutathione by glutathione cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase.

Glutathione is an antioxidant vital to a cell's immune defense, nutrient metabolism, and cellular functions. It also plays an important role in the neutralization of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are by-products of oxygen metabolism, the concentration of which plays a vital role in tumor proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and metastasis.

### 11.5.2 Serine and Glycine Metabolism

SHMT catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine and is regulated by c-MYC, an oncogene that controls the transcription of 15% of human genes. Glycine is a component of glutathione and is required for regulating cellular redox balance. It also fuels nucleotide biosynthesis and sustains oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Thus, glycine metabolism has been shown to promote rapid tumor proliferation.

In an attempt to block glycine biosynthesis, researchers are using antimetabolites (drugs that interfere with the effects of metabolites), methotrexate, and pemetrexed to inhibit SHMT. Since serine and glycine are considered nonessential, their depletion can be tolerated in vivo. Maddocks et al. found that mice fed diets lacking serine and glycine showed a reduction in tumor sizes and survived longer than those fed diets containing the amino acids, indicating that diet regulation may be a potential therapy for investigation.

### 11.5.3 Therapeutic Targeting of Amino Acid Metabolism

**Glutaminase Inhibition**

Inhibition of GLS2 can block glutaminolysis, decrease the hepatic metabolic flux from glutamine to glucose, decrease the initial blood glucose level, and increase insulin sensitivity. Despite some attempts to study the selective inhibition of GLS1 and GLS2, there has not been a defined pharmacological inhibition of GLS2 that is qualified for general use in research.

In addition to blocking glutamate production from glutamine, glutamine supplementation has also been proven effective in cardiovascular disease prevention and sickle cell disease treatment and is used in combination with chemotherapy for cancer treatment. In cancer treatment, the use of dietary glutamine supplementation is to make up for the tumor's "nitrogen trap" behavior that aggressively consumes dietary amino acids as well as the amino acids synthesized by the host.

## 11.6 Metabolic Interactions in the Tumor Microenvironment

### 11.6.1 Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs)

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), play an important role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Recent findings have demonstrated that the TME not only provides physical support for cancer cells but also directs cell-to-cell interactions (in this case, the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs).

As cancer progresses, the CAFs also coevolve, transitioning from an inactivated state to an activated state. The elucidation and understanding of the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs will pave the way for new cancer therapies.

### 11.6.2 Metabolic Cross-Talk

**Lactate Shuttle**

Pyruvate and lactate, the two end products of glycolysis, were believed to be secreted by the hypoxic core of the tumor through monocarboxylate transporters (MCT4) for the adjacent oxygenated cancer cells to take up (via MCT1) and utilize as substrates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

By providing lactate and ketone bodies, acidic compounds that can form acetyl-CoA in a reversible manner, and by taking up reactive oxygen species that promote glycolytic metabolic pathways, CAFs establish a fundamental relationship with adjacent cancer cells. CAFs are also involved in the maintenance of an acidic extracellular environment, providing suitable conditions for optimal cancer cell growth.

**Mitochondrial Transfer**

CAFs can transfer functional mitochondria to prostate cancer cells. Much research has been focused on exosomes secreted by cancer cells, while little is known about exosomes secreted by CAFs. CAF-derived exosomes (CDEs) are taken up by cancer cells in a KRAS-independent mechanism and are, indeed, capable of reprogramming the metabolic activity of pancreatic and prostate cancer cells.

They demonstrated how CDE can sustain the rapidly dividing cancer cells under hypoxic conditions or when the normal oxidative mitochondrial function has been disabled. Additionally, the presence of CDEs can rescue prostate and pancreatic cancer cells from starvation by providing de novo-synthesized metabolites, such as amino acids.


### 11.6.3 Alanine Metabolism: A Critical Metabolic Bridge

**Fundamental Role in Pancreatic Cancer:**

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer, alanine has emerged as a critical non-essential amino acid that outcompetes glucose and glutamine-derived carbon to fuel the TCA cycle. This metabolic reprogramming allows glucose to enter the serine biosynthetic pathway to generate nucleic acids, further contributing to rapid cancer cell proliferation.

**Autophagy-Dependent Alanine Secretion:**

Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) - myofibroblast-like cells that comprise the major stromal component in pancreatic tumors - secrete alanine through an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Cancer cells actively stimulate this autophagic process in PSCs, creating a sophisticated metabolic interaction where cancer cells induce their own nutrient supply. Given that alanine is the second most represented amino acid in proteins, autophagic protein catabolism provides an abundant source of free alanine.

### Transporter-Mediated Metabolic Niche Formation

**Differential Amino Acid Transporter Expression:**

The alanine cross-talk between PSCs and PDAC cells is orchestrated through differential expression of specific membrane transporters:

- **SLC1A4 (Alanine-Serine-Cysteine Transporter 1)**: PSCs utilize this sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter to rapidly exchange and maintain environmental alanine concentrations
- **SLC38A2 (Sodium-coupled Neutral Amino acid Transporter 2)**: PDAC cells upregulate this transporter to actively uptake alanine from the microenvironment

This differential transporter expression creates a highly efficient metabolic niche that facilitates directed nutrient flow from stromal to cancer cells.

### Metabolic Fate and Integration

**Alanine-to-Pyruvate Conversion:**

Once internalized by cancer cells, alanine undergoes transamination to pyruvate through specific aminotransferases:
- **GPT1**: Cytosolic glutamic-pyruvic transaminase converts alanine to pyruvate in the cytoplasm
- **GPT2**: Mitochondrial isoform that PDAC cells selectively express for direct mitochondrial alanine utilization

**Mitochondrial Metabolism:**

Importantly, alanine-derived pyruvate does not equilibrate with cytosolic pyruvate, providing a direct mitochondrial carbon source without altering the cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox balance. This compartmentalization offers several metabolic advantages:
- Maintained cytosolic redox homeostasis
- Direct fueling of mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle
- Enhanced metabolic flexibility under nutrient stress

### Biosynthetic Contributions

**Lipid Synthesis:**

Isotope tracing studies reveal that alanine makes substantial contributions to biosynthetic processes. More than 20% of palmitate and 10% of stearate contain alanine-derived carbon, rivaling glucose's contribution to fatty acid synthesis. This demonstrates that alanine functions not merely as alternative fuel but as a primary biosynthetic substrate.

**Metabolic Reallocation:**

By utilizing alanine for TCA cycle fueling, cancer cells can redirect glucose toward other critical biosynthetic pathways, particularly serine and glycine synthesis for nucleotide production. This metabolic reallocation provides:
- Enhanced anabolic capacity
- Improved resource utilization efficiency
- Better adaptation to nutrient-poor microenvironments

### Metabolic Crisis and Therapeutic Vulnerability

**SLC38A2 Dependency:**

Loss of SLC38A2 in PDAC cells creates a profound metabolic crisis. Without this transporter, cells cannot effectively concentrate intracellular alanine, leading to:
- Increased demand for de novo alanine synthesis
- Metabolic shunting of cytosolic pyruvate and nitrogen sources toward mitochondrial alanine biosynthesis
- Passive efflux of newly synthesized alanine to the environment

This metabolic disruption results in significantly impaired tumor growth, suggesting SLC38A2 as a potential therapeutic target.

### Integration with Broader Cancer Metabolism

**Connection to Other Metabolic Pathways:**

The alanine metabolism network intersects with multiple other metabolic processes:
- **Glutaminolysis**: Glutamine provides nitrogen for alanine synthesis through transamination
- **Branched-chain amino acid metabolism**: BCAA catabolism contributes nitrogen sources for alanine biosynthesis  
- **Glycolysis**: Pyruvate serves as both precursor and product in alanine metabolism

**Tumor Microenvironment Context:**

This metabolic cross-talk becomes particularly critical in the nutrient-depleted pancreatic tumor microenvironment, characterized by:
- Desmoplastic reaction limiting vascularization
- Hypoxic and acidic conditions
- Limited glucose and glutamine availability

Under these conditions, the PSC-cancer cell alanine shuttle provides a metabolic lifeline that supports continued tumor growth and progression.

### Clinical and Therapeutic Implications

The understanding of metabolic cross-talk, particularly alanine metabolism, reveals potential therapeutic strategies:
- **Transporter targeting**: SLC38A2 inhibition disrupts alanine uptake
- **Autophagy modulation**: Preventing PSC autophagy reduces alanine supply
- **Aminotransferase inhibition**: Blocking alanine-to-pyruvate conversion
- **Combination approaches**: Targeting multiple nodes in the metabolic network simultaneously

This metabolic interdependence between cancer and stromal cells represents both a survival mechanism for cancer cells in harsh microenvironments and a potential therapeutic vulnerability that could be exploited for treatment.

## 11.7 Therapeutic Targeting of Cancer Metabolism

### 11.7.1 Targeting Glycolysis

In order to disrupt the metabolic bridge in CAF-cancer cell interactions through glycolysis and lactate metabolism inhibition, three potential strategies have been proposed. First, elevated expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 in cancer cells is a potential target for blocking cellular uptake of two types of mitochondrial fuels, ketone bodies and lactate.

MCT1 and MCT2 inhibitors can block the influx and efflux of lactate produced by either CAFs or cancer cells. Thus, due to the rapid accumulation of lactate and protons within cancer cells by inhibiting lactate influx/efflux, rapid acidification can occur in cancer cells and the TME, resulting in lactic acidosis.

For instance, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (ACCA), an MCT inhibitor, not only inhibits lactic acid efflux in glycolytic gliomas but also disrupts redox hemostasis and enhances radiosensitivity. AZD3965, an MCT1 inhibitor, is currently being tested in phase I clinical trial in solid tumors.

### 11.7.2 Targeting Lipid Metabolism

The first fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor, TVB-2640, is in clinical trials for cancer. Markers such as cell type, oncogene mutations, expression/activity of lipid synthesis enzymes, and metabolic profiles can be used to predict cancer cell sensitivity to lipid synthesis inhibition.

The fact that lipoprotein supplementation can override DNLS inhibition emphasizes the importance of nutrient availability and, again, the role of exogenous lipid uptake. The availability of glucose for glucose-dependent lipogenesis is also important for cancer cell sensitivity to ACLY inhibitors. Low-glucose environments result in cancer cells that are less susceptible to ACLY inhibition because cancer cells can use acetate instead of citrate to produce acetyl-CoA for DNLS.

### 11.7.3 Combination Strategies

**Metabolic Inhibitor Combinations**

Elgogary et al. present another case of spatial metabolic heterogeneity. Pancreatic tumors were targeted by bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), a glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibitor, which was encapsulated in a nanoparticle to enhance drug delivery. The drug decreased tumor sizes, but metabolomics analysis revealed that surviving tumors relied on glycolysis and glycogen synthesis instead. Thus, further combination therapy of BPTES and metformin, a drug frequently used to treat diabetes by blocking glucose synthesis, further reduced tumor size.

**Targeting CAF-Cancer Interactions**

Metabolic cross talk between CAFs and cancer can be a metabolic target for cancer therapy. The reverse Warburg effects can be targeted via disruption of the "lactate shuttle" by MCT1/MCT 4 inhibitors. Metformin can be used to inhibit glycolysis and block the function of CAFs, which promote cancer cell growth. Blocking the glutamine uptake of cancer cells from CAFs is a strategy in targeting glutaminolysis.

### 11.7.4 Challenges in Metabolic Targeting

**Drug Resistance and Metabolism**

The response to cytotoxic drugs often depends on the metabolic state of the cancer cells, and these cells rewire the metabolism of anticancer drugs. Metabolic alterations can be influenced by various factors such as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and the tumor microenvironment.

Downstream of survival signaling pathways, the Warburg effect, which refers to the increased rate of glycolysis in tumorigenic cells, can be observed even in conditions of normal oxygen levels. In c-Myc-driven HCC, glucose catabolism through glycolysis is elevated via the activation of pyruvate kinase. Inhibition of glycolysis and increase in oxidative phosphorylation can re-sensitize HCC cells to chemotherapeutics such as sorafenib, cisplatin, and isoliensinine.

**Tumor Microenvironment Factors**

Solid tumors are heterogeneous structures. The tumor microenvironment is composed of cancer and stromal cells embedded in extracellular matrix, sustained by aberrant vasculature. Tumor hypoperfusion, secondary to the hyperpermeability of the aberrant vasculature, along with low oxygen, depleted nutrition, low pH, and high interstitial pressure can cause chemoresistance.

Compared to normal cells, cancer cells exhibit higher glucose metabolism rates and preferentially utilize glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, especially in hypoxic conditions (Warburg effect). This process ultimately generates lactic acid, leading to intracellular acidification. As a result, cancer cells may express relatively more proton pumps in order to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis, rendering the extracellular environment highly acidic.

## 11.8 Future Directions and Clinical Translation

### 11.8.1 Personalized Metabolic Therapy

There is heterogeneity in glucose metabolism across tumor types as well as within the tumor microenvironment. Numerous therapies targeting glucose metabolism have been developed but have yet to show success in clinical trials. This highlights the need for better patient selection and understanding of metabolic heterogeneity.

The tumor microenvironment influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to lipid synthesis inhibition. Understanding these contextual factors will be crucial for successful clinical translation of metabolic therapies.

### 11.8.2 Integration with Other Treatment Modalities

Natural products can also increase the sensitivity of HCC cells to anticancer drugs by regulating cellular metabolism. Li and colleagues demonstrated that dauricine dose-dependently suppressed glucose glycolysis and increased oxidative phosphorylation by downregulating the expression of hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2, consequently increasing the sensitivities of HCC to cisplatin, sorafenib, and isoliensinie.

Experimental data show that natural products can reverse MDR via regulating drug efflux, drug metabolism, and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells. Despite a better understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance, and the experimental approaches that have been taken to overcome drug resistance over the decades, clinical utility of these approaches has not come to fruition.

### 11.8.3 Systems Biology Approaches

Simply put, what makes cancer one of the deadliest diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells' rapid evolution, coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide, gives most of them the advantage over our immune systems.

The logical question that arises is simple: Why, despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time, has a complete cure eluded us? This chapter sheds light on one of cancer's most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and, more specifically, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism.

## Conclusion

Cancer metabolism represents a complex and dynamic aspect of tumor biology that extends far beyond the classical Warburg effect. The metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer cells serves multiple functions: supporting elevated energy demands, providing building blocks for biosynthesis, maintaining redox balance, and facilitating adaptation to the challenging tumor microenvironment.

The discovery that cancer metabolism involves not only the cancer cells themselves but also the supporting stromal cells, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts, has revolutionized our understanding of tumor biology. The metabolic cross-talk between these different cell types creates a complex ecosystem that supports tumor growth and progression.

Key findings from authoritative sources reveal that:

1. **The Warburg effect remains relevant** but represents only one aspect of cancer metabolism, with significant heterogeneity both between and within tumors.

2. **Mitochondria retain important functions** in cancer cells, contributing to both energy production and biosynthetic processes essential for tumor growth.

3. **Lipid and amino acid metabolism** are extensively reprogrammed in cancer, with particular importance for glutamine metabolism and fatty acid synthesis.

4. **The tumor microenvironment** plays a crucial role in cancer metabolism, with cancer-associated fibroblasts acting as metabolic partners that support cancer cell growth.

5. **Therapeutic targeting** of cancer metabolism shows promise but faces challenges related to metabolic flexibility, drug resistance, and the need for personalized approaches.

Despite significant advances in understanding cancer metabolism, successful clinical translation remains challenging. The metabolic flexibility of cancer cells, the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, and the heterogeneity within and between tumors all contribute to the difficulty in developing effective metabolic therapies.

Future success in targeting cancer metabolism will likely require:
- Better understanding of metabolic heterogeneity
- Development of combination therapeutic strategies
- Integration with other treatment modalities
- Personalized approaches based on tumor metabolic phenotyping
- Systems biology approaches that consider the entire tumor ecosystem

As our understanding of the intricate relationships between cancer cells and their metabolic environment continues to expand, new opportunities for therapeutic intervention will undoubtedly emerge, offering hope for more effective cancer treatments in the future.
