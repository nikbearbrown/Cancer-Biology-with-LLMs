# Chapter 2: Introduction to Cancer: A Disease of Deregulation

## 2.1 Defining Cancer: Uncontrolled Growth and Invasion

The fundamental abnormality resulting in the development of cancer is the continual unregulated proliferation of cancer cells. Rather than responding appropriately to the signals that control normal cell behavior, cancer cells grow and divide in an uncontrolled manner, invading normal tissues and organs and eventually spreading throughout the body. In simple terms, cancer is a group of more than 100 diseases that develop across time and involve the uncontrolled division of the body's cells.

### 2.1.1 Cancer as a Cellular Disease

What happens to cause a cell to become cancerous? Thirty years ago, scientists could not offer a coherent answer to this question. They knew that cancer arose from cells that began to proliferate uncontrollably within the body, and they knew that chemicals, radiation, and viruses could trigger this change. But exactly how it happened was a mystery. Research across the last three decades, however, has revolutionized our understanding of cancer.

The generalized loss of growth control exhibited by cancer cells is the net result of accumulated abnormalities in multiple cell regulatory systems and is reflected in several aspects of cell behavior that distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts.

### 2.1.2 The Multistep Process of Carcinogenesis

Carcinogenesis can be divided conceptually into four steps: tumor initiation, tumor promotion, malignant conversion, and tumor progression. Cancer usually develops through the transformation of normal cells into malignant tumor cells, often progressing from a precancerous condition to a fully developed tumor.

A central feature of today's molecular view of cancer is that cancer does not develop all at once, but across time, as a long and complex succession of genetic changes. Each change enables precancerous cells to acquire some of the traits that together create the malignant growth of cancer cells.

The stages of carcinogenesis include:

1. **Initiation**: After initiation, carcinogenesis advances through the promotion and progression stages. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the initiation phase is crucial for developing strategies to prevent, detect, and treat cancer.

2. **Promotion**: The expansion of initiated cells through enhanced proliferation or reduced apoptosis.

3. **Progression**: Tumor progression comprises the expression of the malignant phenotype and the tendency of malignant cells to acquire more aggressive characteristics over time.

### 2.1.3 Distinguishing Characteristics of Malignancy

Cancer can result from abnormal proliferation of any of the different kinds of cells in the body, so there are more than a hundred distinct types of cancer, which can vary substantially in their behavior and response to treatment.

**Uncontrolled Proliferation**

When either of these proteins is not functioning correctly, downstream elements are not properly functioning, such as the INK4a/ARF, which encodes for tumor suppressor proteins. However, tumors may grow, leading to cancer in these specific cells.

**Cellular Atypia**

Morphologically, the cancerous cell is characterized by a large nucleus, having an irregular size and shape, the nucleoli are prominent, the cytoplasm is scarce and intensely colored or, on the contrary, is pale.

**Altered Metabolism**

The cancerous cell is particularly characterized by a poor use of oxygen and the massive use of glucose, which is exclusively converted to lactic acid. Consequently, malignant cells take from blood a 5–10 fold glucose amount compared to normal cells and they produce a corresponding lactic acid amount that will be recycled and changed back to glucose in the liver.

### 2.1.4 Cancer as a Systemic Disease

Tumors threaten an individual's life when their growth disrupts the tissues and organs needed for survival. However, cancer's impact extends far beyond the primary tumor site, manifesting as a complex systemic disease that affects multiple organ systems throughout the body.

#### The Systemic Nature of Cancer

Invasion and metastasis are the most insidious and life-threatening aspects of cancer. The capacity for invasion may not be expressed initially or in all tumors. Those tumors with minimal or no invasion may be extirpated successfully leading to cure in some patients. However, most cancers gradually unmask their invasive potential: progressing over time to frank malignancy from preexisting carcinoma in situ, adenomas, or disorders of epithelial proliferation.

Fewer than one-third of newly diagnosed solid tumor patients can be cured by local therapeutic modalities alone. This sobering statistic underscores why cancer must be understood as a systemic disease rather than merely a localized growth disorder.

#### Mechanisms of Systemic Disease

##### Metastatic Spread

Once the neoplasm becomes invasive, it can disseminate via the lymphatics and/or vascular channels that it induces through tumor-stimulated lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis and other perturbations of the local microenvironment. Invasion and metastases kill hosts through two processes: local invasion and distant organ colonization and injury.

To reach the brain, a systemic cancer must develop its own blood supply, invade local tissues, and enter the circulation either by invading venules or lymph channels that eventually reach the venous circulation. Because systemic tumors enter the venous circulation and, ultimately, the right side of the heart, the first capillary bed they encounter is in the lung.

The metastatic process is complex and systematic: The process of metastasis is complex and arduous, which incorporates multiple cells, factors and stages. During the development and progression of primary tumors, certain clones of tumor cells will have the required genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to enable themselves to interact with the local microenvironment.

##### Common Sites of Metastasis

Cancer exhibits predictable patterns of spread to specific organ systems:

- Adrenal glands are the fourth most common site of metastases in malignant disease, which is significant considering the relatively small size of adrenals. Adrenal metastasis can occur from primaries in the lung (39%), breast (35%), melanoma, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and kidney, among other places.

- Brain metastases are a common complication of cancer and the most common type of brain tumor. Anywhere from 10% to 26% of patients who die from their cancer will develop brain metastases.

- Prostate cancer posed the highest risk for bone metastases (18% to 29%) followed by lung, renal, or breast cancer.

 ##### Timeline and Progression

The median time from cancer diagnosis to the identification of adrenal metastases is about 2.5 years, although adrenal metastases have been reported up to 22 years after initial treatment of primary tumors. This demonstrates that cancer's systemic effects can manifest years after initial diagnosis and treatment.

## 2.2 History of Cancer Research

### 2.2.1 Ancient Origins and Early Documentation

Cancer is often wrongly considered to be a modern disease in many popular medical venues. Cancers have been known to humanity since ancient times. Recent findings support the ancient origins of cancer, with the discovery of osteosarcoma in a hominin foot bone over one million years old in South Africa—suggesting that cancer has been present as long as humanity itself.

References to cancer can be found in historical records as far back as 1700 BC, including the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, the ancient Egyptian Ebers and Smith Papyrus, and the Chinese Rites of the Zhou Dynasty. Early mentions of cancer are also documented in medieval Islamic texts and the ancient Indian Ramayana.

#### Ancient Egyptian Medicine

Our oldest description of cancer (although the word cancer was not used) was discovered in Egypt and dates back to about 3000 BC. It's called the Edwin Smith Papyrus and is a copy of part of an ancient Egyptian textbook on trauma surgery. It describes 8 cases of tumors or ulcers of the breast that were removed by cauterization with a tool called the fire drill. The writing says about the disease, "There is no treatment."

The first description of human cancer can be found in the Edwin Smith Papyrus dated 3000 BC that illustrated a case of breast cancer. Other documented proof includes the Ebers Papyrus dating from 1500 BC that describes several types of tumors concerning skin, uterus, stomach, and rectum. These old Egyptian documents recorded cancer as a grave incurable disease and associated it to 'the curse of the gods'.

#### Paleropathological Evidence

The discipline that allows scientists to investigate the antiquity of diseases is called palaeopathology (from Greek: παλαιός = ancient, πάθος = suffering, disease, λόγος = study, research). Palaeopathology utilises both invasive and non-invasive methodologies and techniques also adopted by contemporary medicine (such as histology, radiology, genetics) that offer a complete picture of the clinical presentation of diseases in ancient populations, which are still present in the modern world.

Among the types of cancer found in Ancient Egypt are numerous malignant conditions that are well known by contemporary medical research: osteosarcoma, multiple myeloma, osteolytic metastatic carcinoma, mixed metastatic carcinoma, multiple myeloma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, primary osteolytic tumor.

### 2.2.2 Greek and Roman Contributions

#### Hippocrates: The Father of Medicine

Hippocrates (460 – 377 BC), considered the "father of medicine," was a Greek physician and teacher of medicine whose name today is associated with the high ethical standard of Western medicine. The origin of the word cancer is credited to the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 BC), who is considered the "Father of Medicine." Hippocrates used the terms carcinos and carcinoma to describe non-ulcer forming and ulcer-forming tumors. In Greek, these words refer to a crab, most likely applied to the disease because the finger-like spreading projections from a cancer called to mind the shape of a crab.

The Hippocratic physicians initiated the discussion on the treatment of cancer and suggested that the most difficult cancers to treat were those of the axillae, the flank of the body, and the thigh. Nevertheless, they advised not to treat surgically cancers that had not ulcerated, because they were thought to be incurable and any interference would lead to the death of the patient, while otherwise the patient might live for a long time.

Hippocrates hypothesized that this disease was correlated to an excess of black bile. He believed that cancers, and more broadly any disease, developed whenever the balance in the four body humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) were lost. Whenever black bile became the dominant humours in some part of the body, this developed cancer.

#### Roman Medicine and Celsus

The Roman physician, Celsus (25 BC - 50 AD), later translated the Greek term into cancer, the Latin word for crab. De Medicina included writings on nutrition, pharmacology, surgery, and mental diseases. It drew largely from earlier Greek medical writers and is the source for what we know today about the medical and surgical practices of the Hellenistic period.

#### Galen's Influence

Galen (130-200 AD), another Greek physician, used the word oncos (Greek for swelling) to describe tumors. Although the crab analogy of Hippocrates and Celsus is still used to describe malignant tumors, Galen's term is now used as a part of the name for cancer specialists – oncologists.

Claudius Galen (130-200), a Greek physician who practiced medicine in Rome, implemented the Hippocrates theory. He proposed that black bile caused incurable cancer, whereas yellow bile caused curable cancer. Galen, who made a detailed categorization of abnormal growths (he even wrote a treatise named On tumors against nature), believed that cancer may appear in any part of the body, but he had seen it more often occurring in the breasts of women whose menstruation was either abnormal or inexistent.

### 2.2.3 Medieval Medicine and Islamic Contributions

#### The Golden Age of Islamic Medicine

From the 8th to 16th centuries A.D., Islamic physician-philosophers revived the Hippocratic philosophy that based disease causation on bodily 'humors'. Political patronage promoted these efforts: one excellent example is that of Chosroes I (also known as Khusraw) in the 6th century, who sent the Persian Zoroastrian doctor, Perzhoe, to distant lands like India to learn both philosophy and medicine so as to enrich the lives of the people in his empire.

Islamic medicine is regarded as a comprehensive medical school with a long, glorious and worldwide reputation. Some of the physicians of this school are famous worldwide and have contributed valuable services to the scientific world. Islamic scholars translated their voluminous writings from Greek into Arabic and then produced new medical knowledge based on those texts. In order to make the Greek tradition more accessible, understandable, and teachable, Islamic scholars ordered and made more systematic the vast and sometimes inconsistent Greco-Roman medical knowledge by writing encyclopedias and summaries.

#### Key Islamic Physicians and Cancer Understanding

In this writing, we will discuss cancer and the ways to its diagnose and treatments from the viewpoint of a few of the most famous physicians before the Mongolian attack who practiced Islamic medicine. The ideas discussed here dates back to the era between the eighth and fourteenth centuries.

**Rhazes (Al-Razi):** Rhazes was the most important specialist in clinical and practical medicine in the Islamic world. In his famous book, Alhawi, he has described the views of the scientists who lived before him and in between, together with his own opinions: Galen has quoted from Dioscorides that applying a poultice prepared from hedge mustard (Erysimum officinale L.) is useful for the treatment of non-ulcerative cancer.

**Avicenna (Ibn Sina):** The Canon was translated into Latin by Gerardo de Cremona in the 13th century and dominated medical curriculum in European universities until the 17th century, earning the accolade of 'the most famous medical textbook ever written' by Sir William Osler.

**Jorjani:** Jorjani has assigned parts of Zakhireh to cancer. In his point of view, cancer is a kind of black bile swelling which is, unlike scirrhus, accompanied by pain, pulsation, inflammation and angiogenesis. These characteristics could be applied for the differential diagnosis of cancer from scirrhus.

#### Medieval Disease Concepts

Cancer, the Latin word for crab, was applied to the disease by the Roman physician Celsus as a translation from the Hippocratic term karkinos. By the late medieval period, the analogy of cancer as a hungry beast was well established. In the Middle Ages, religious beliefs inhibited the advancement of knowledge, and people began to believe that cancer was an infectious disease.

### 2.2.4 The Renaissance Revolution

#### Challenging Ancient Authorities

The Medical Renaissance started as the regular Renaissance did in the early 1400s and ended in the late 1600s. During this time great medical personalities and scholar humanists made unique advances to medicine and surgery. The Renaissance was a revolutionary period, since it stimulated medical practice; at that time physicians started to scientifically study medicine. Vesalius greatly contributed in the advancement of surgery, and he vigorously opposed Galen's doctrines.

#### Andreas Vesalius and Anatomical Revolution

Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) is considered the Father of Modern Anatomy, and an authentic representative of the Renaissance. His studies, founded on dissection of human bodies, differed from Galeno, who based his work on dissection of animals, constituted a notable scientific advance. Andreas Vesalius and Ambroise Paré followed thereafter, making outstanding anatomical contributions with the publication of the "Human Factory" (1543) by Vesalius, and describing unique surgical developments with the publication of the "The Apologie and Treatise of Ambroise Paré."

Vesalius' work emphasized the priority of dissection and what has come to be called the "anatomical" view of the body, seeing human internal functioning as an essentially corporeal structure filled with organs arranged in three-dimensional space. This was in stark contrast to many of the anatomical models used previously.

#### William Harvey and Circulation

At the end of the Renaissance and beginning of the New Science, William Harvey, noted British medical doctor and cardiovascular researcher, discovered the general circulation. He published his findings in "The Motu Cordis" in 1628. Further groundbreaking work was carried out by William Harvey, who published De Motu Cordis in 1628. Harvey made a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart, going on to an analysis of the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery.

### 2.2.5 The Rise of Scientific Pathology (19th Century)

#### Rudolf Virchow and Cellular Pathology

Virchow was one of the 19th century's foremost leaders in medicine and pathology. He was also a public health activist, social reformer, politician, and anthropologist. Virchow was the first to correctly link the origin of cancers from otherwise normal cells, believing that cancer is caused by severe irritation in the tissues (the 'chronic irritation theory').

Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), the great German pathologist of the 19th century, founder of the "Zellularpathologie", also dealt with principal problems of tumor pathology. His theoretical concepts concern the definition and characterization of the tumor process, the dignity and diagnosis, published especially in his 3 monographs "Die Entwicklungsgeschichte des Krebses" (1847), "Handbuch der speciellen Pathologie und Therapie" (1854) and "Die krankhaften Geschwülste" (1863-65).

After graduating from Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Berlin in 1843, his major work was in pathology, becoming its professor in Pathological Anatomy and Physiology in 1854. He developed an interest in microscopy. His first scientific paper was two years after graduating, on the pathological description of leukaemia, a term he invented.

#### The Impact of Microscopy

In 1847, he and a colleague, Benino Reinhardt, founded the Archiv für Pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie (now known as "Virchow's Archives"), which still survives as a leading journal of pathology. He encouraged his students to use microscopes and "think microscopically." Virchow had a major impact on medical education in Germany.

The years 1852 and 1854–55 were then marked by long and heated debates on these questions among the Parisian medical community. During the same period, thanks to Remak and then Virchow, the principle of cell division became an important component of the renewed cell theory.

#### Cell Theory and Cancer

Virchow strongly believed that the tumour, like any other physiological or pathological phenomenon, was always a part of the patient's body, being strictly subject to the laws of biology. Virchow consistently applied the concept of the cell as the place of all pathological processes even to tumour pathology.

### 2.2.6 The 20th Century: Institutional Development

#### Early 20th Century Context

At the beginning of the 20th century, cancer was eighth among the leading causes of death. Infectious diseases were prominent, with pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal diseases being responsible for one-third of all deaths. At the beginning of the century, cases of lung cancer was so rare that it was shown to medical students as a condition that the students were unlikely to see again during their medical practices. By the 1940s, however, lung cancer was becoming quite common.

#### The National Cancer Institute Era

In the United States, a definitive effort to combat cancer and advance scientific research began with the establishment of the National Cancer Institute in 1937. This initiative gained further momentum with the passage of the National Cancer Act in 1971. In 1937 the National Cancer Institute Act established the National Cancer Institute (NCI) within the U.S. Public Health Service. The Act directed the Surgeon General to promote the coordination of research conducted by the Institute and similar research conducted by other agencies, organizations, and individuals.

### 2.2.7 The War on Cancer: The National Cancer Act of 1971

#### Political and Social Context

The struggle against cancer took a decisive turn in 1971 when a relentless campaigning by health activists eventually led to signing of the National Cancer Act in the United States, an unprecedented event in the history of diseases. By 1970, cancer was the second leading cause of death in the U.S. and the number one health concern of the American people. Recognizing public anxiety and the need for more funding for cancer research, Mary Lasker and other advocates pushed for legislation that would substantially increase the country's commitment to making advances against the deadly disease.

#### The Act's Provisions and Impact

The National Cancer Act of 1971, signed into law by President Richard Nixon, established the National Cancer Institute in its current form. This sweeping legislation granted to the Director of the NCI broad authority to plan and develop an expanded, intensified and coordinated National Cancer Program that included the NCI and related programs, other research institutes and federal and nonfederal programs. The National Cancer Act also authorized the first 15 cancer centers and mandated cancer control programs.

The National Cancer Act of 1971 instigated 50 years of momentum that raised the federal investment in cancer research from $500 million in 1972 to $6.5 billion in 2021. This investment has fueled basic, translational, and clinical research that has had a tremendous impact on our understanding of cancer and our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat it.

#### Key Achievements

"The National Cancer Act is one of the most transformational pieces of legislation to occur in the 20th century. It is that profound," said ­Andrew C. von Eschenbach, MD, President of Samaritan Health Initiatives and Adjunct Professor at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and former Director of the NCI from 2002 to 2005 and former Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2005 to 2009.

On Dec. 23, 1971, President Richard Nixon signed NCA into law, providing NCI with expanded authorities and responsibilities through development of a National Cancer Program. One of the most forward-thinking concepts to emerge was the modern-day NCI Cancer Centers Program, an anchor of the nation's cancer research effort. NCA initially directed NCI to establish 15 new research facilities. There are now 71 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers in 36 states and the District of Columbia.

#### Scientific Infrastructure Development

The act established a democratization of the scientific process. The act created several advisory boards allowing for more influence on cancer policy by physicians and scientists conducting research and treating patients. This led to more funds being disbursed to institutes and centers outside the government. It especially accelerated the use of investigator-initiated grants.

Another vital mandate of NCA was collection, analysis and dissemination of data that can provide insights into the state of cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. That directive prompted establishment of SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) in 1973. SEER now covers 48 percent of the nation's population, including 22 different geographic areas, and collects data on approximately 800,000 new cancer cases (without any personally identifying information) each year.

### 2.2.8 Modern Era and Future Directions

#### Contemporary Achievements

The NCA's passage half a century ago has contributed to the consistent decline in the overall cancer death rate in the U.S., which has gone down 31 percent since its peak in 1991. A key contributor to that decline is progress in cancer prevention, including the HPV vaccine, comprehensive tobacco control programs that have slashed smoking rates, and effective screening options for colorectal and breast cancers.

The scientific advances enabled by the act have resulted in FDA approval of about 100 targeted therapies to treat cancers that harbor a specific genomic alteration, often achieving remarkable remissions in difficult-to-treat cancers, including NSCLC and metastatic melanoma, and has led to the promise of personalized medicine for all patients with cancer.

#### Continuing Challenges and Opportunities

Although the investment made in cancer over the past 5 decades is still paying off, as witnessed by the more than 17 million cancer survivors today—that number is expected to climb to more than 22 million over the next decade, and the 5-year survival rate is expected to increase to 70%—challenges remain.

The twenty first century began with completion of the Human Genome Project that generated a treasure trove of genetic data. The second leg of the project, called the Cancer Genome Atlas, was launched by NIH in 2005 to catalogue genomic changes in all the cancers known to humans: within less than a decade, cancer research moved from Human Genome Project to "a project at least 10,000 times bigger when applied to fifty most common human cancers", as Francis Collins described it.

## 2.3 Hallmarks of Cancer

Currently, the most widely recognized description of the nature of cancer is that presented by Hanahan and Weinberg in two reviews – published more than a decade apart – that identify the "hallmarks" of cancer. These papers have been so influential that others refer to "the hallmarks" without further qualification. Since 2000, about 200 cancer research papers with a title including "hallmark" or "hallmarks" have been published.

### 2.3.1 The Original Six Hallmarks

Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by diverse molecular signatures, yet all share common cellular phenotypic traits and functional capabilities. Hanahan and Weinberg identified these traits as the hallmarks of cancer, which include increased cell proliferation, achieved through sustained proliferative signaling or evasion of growth suppressors.

Among a series of reviews marking the publication of the 100th volume of the journal Cell, Hanahan and Weinberg (2000) delineated the very wide spectrum of studies addressing the genetics of cancer by reference to phenotype. Six characteristics of how cancer cells behave could be identified in relation to particular genes or classes of genes. The phenotypic characteristics were: uncontrolled proliferative activity, tumour growth attributable to familial risk, survival of cancer cells, immortalization of cancer cells, growth of blood vessels in tumours (angiogenesis), and metastatic growth.

Accordingly, the hallmarks of cancer were initially identified as follows:

1. **Self-Sufficiency in Growth Signals**: Cancer cells generate their own growth-promoting signals, becoming independent of external stimulation for proliferation.

2. **Insensitivity to Anti-Growth Signals**: Cancer cells resist signals that normally halt cell division, allowing continued proliferation despite inhibitory cues.

3. **Evading Apoptosis**: Cancer cells develop mechanisms to avoid programmed cell death, enabling survival under conditions that would normally trigger cell death.

4. **Limitless Replicative Potential**: Cancer cells overcome normal limits on the number of cell divisions, achieving immortalization.

5. **Sustained Angiogenesis**: Cancer cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels to support tumor growth and provide nutrients.

6. **Tissue Invasion and Metastasis**: Cancer cells acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant sites.

### 2.3.2 The Next Generation: Updated Hallmarks

In 2011, Hanahan and Weinberg provided a new assessment of the hallmarks. They commented, "The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress towards understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of each hallmark." It is notable that, in almost every instance, the hallmark is not the name of a phenotype but refers to a dynamic process.

The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumours. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease.

The original hallmarks were rebadged as follows:
- **Sustaining Proliferative Signaling**
- **Evading Growth Suppressors**
- **Resisting Cell Death**
- **Enabling Replicative Immortality**
- **Inducing Angiogenesis**
- **Activating Invasion and Metastasis**

### 2.3.3 Emerging Hallmarks and Enabling Characteristics

A decade of progress had enabled the specification of two "emerging hallmarks":

1. **Reprogramming of Energy Metabolism**: The malignant tumor also has an altered metabolism, including accelerated glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and lipid synthesis.

2. **Evading Immune Destruction**: Cancer cells develop mechanisms to avoid detection and elimination by the immune system.

**Enabling Characteristics**

Two enabling characteristics facilitate the acquisition of these traits: genomic instability and tumor-promoting inflammation. Additionally, deregulated tumor metabolism has emerged as a defining feature of cancer cells.

The enabling characteristic identified in 2000 as "genomic instability" was described in 2011 as "genomic instability and mutation", and a second enabling characteristic was identified as "tumor-promoting inflammation".

The identification of "tumour-promoting inflammation" as the second enabling characteristic recognizes that inflammation causes the emergence of several of the hallmarks, including sustaining proliferative signalling and inducing angiogenesis.

### 2.3.4 Clinical and Research Implications

Moreover, identifying cancer hallmarks has redefined the understanding of carcinogenesis, providing a more comprehensive view of cancer as a process driven by the accumulation of these hallmarks. Carcinogenesis can be viewed as a series of genetic and epigenetic changes that gradually allow cells to acquire these hallmarks, ultimately leading to full cancer development.

Second, it is now understood that specific hallmarks of cancer cells cause the clinically evident tumor mass and are fundamental to developing and maintaining the malignant state, including metastases. These include resistance to apoptosis; the ability to replicate indefinitely (immortality); the ability to invade and metastasize; accelerated proliferation, including resistance to growth-stopping signals; and sustained angiogenesis.

## 2.4 Terminology in Oncology

### 2.4.1 Classification of Neoplasms

The most important issue in cancer pathology is the distinction between benign and malignant tumors. A tumor is any abnormal proliferation of cells, which may be either benign or malignant. Understanding the precise classification of neoplasms is fundamental to diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis.

#### Benign vs. Malignant Tumors

**Benign Tumors**

A benign tumor, such as a common skin wart, remains confined to its original location, neither invading surrounding normal tissue nor spreading to distant body sites. Benign tumors usually don't cause much damage and aren't normally life-threatening. But there's no guarantee: Benign growths may sometimes become malignant after some time.

Most phyllodes tumors behave benignly, with local recurrences occurring in a small proportion of cases. Very rarely, the tumor may metastasize, most commonly in malignant-grade tumors. Local recurrences can occur in all phyllodes tumors at an overall rate of 21%, with ranges of 10% to 17%, 14% to 25%, and 23% to 30% for benign, borderline malignant, and phyllodes tumors, respectively.

**Malignant Tumors**

A malignant tumor, however, is capable of both invading surrounding normal tissue and spreading throughout the body via the circulatory or lymphatic systems (metastasis). Only malignant tumors are properly referred to as cancers, and it is their ability to invade and metastasize that makes cancer so dangerous.

A tumor, or mass of cells, formed of these abnormal cells may remain within the tissue in which it originated (a condition called in situ cancer), or it may begin to invade nearby tissues (a condition called invasive cancer). An invasive tumor is said to be malignant, and cells shed into the blood or lymph from a malignant tumor are likely to establish new tumors (metastases).

#### Tissue of Origin Classification

Both benign and malignant tumors are classified according to the type of cell from which they arise. Most cancers fall into one of three main groups: carcinomas, sarcomas, and leukemias or lymphomas.

**Carcinomas**

Carcinomas, which include approximately 90% of human cancers, are malignancies of epithelial cells. These tumors arise from tissues that line the surfaces of organs and body cavities.

The histological subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma include squamous cell carcinoma in situ/Bowen disease, acantholytic/adenoid/pseudoglandular, clear cell, sarcomatoid/spindle cell, desmoplastic, keratoacanthoma, and verrucous carcinoma. High-risk histological subtypes include acantholytic, sarcomatoid, and desmoplastic.

**Sarcomas**

Sarcomas, which are rare in humans, are solid tumors of connective tissues, such as muscle, bone, cartilage, and fibrous tissue. Soft tissue sarcomas account for approximately 1% of all cancer incidence in the United States and represent approximately 2% of cancer-related deaths.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a malignant soft tissue sarcoma that is believed to originate from primitive mesenchymal cells that typically differentiate into skeletal tissue. However, these tumors can also arise in other types of tissue and any anatomic area. RMS is the most common soft tissue sarcoma diagnosed in children; only 1% of these cancers are found in adults.

Angiosarcoma (AS) comprises 1% of all soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), which are themselves a rare malignancy. They arise from lymphatic or vascular endothelial cells and are 'high-grade' by definition, which demonstrates their aggressive behavior.

**Hematologic Malignancies**

Leukemias and lymphomas, which account for approximately 8% of human malignancies, arise from the blood-forming cells and from cells of the immune system, respectively.

Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from the clonal proliferation of B-cell, T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell subsets of lymphocytes at different stages of maturation. Lymphoma comprises heterogeneous malignancies that arise from the clonal proliferation of lymphocytes. It represents approximately 5% of malignancies. Overall survival is estimated to be 72%.

### 2.4.2 Grading and Differentiation

Cancer grading describes the microscopic appearance of the tumor's cells and tissue. Low-grade tumors have relatively normal-appearing cells and tissue structures. These tumors are considered well-differentiated. Higher-grade tumors have more abnormal-appearing cells and tissue that is structured abnormally. Higher-grade tumors are typically more aggressive and have a worse prognosis. They are described as poorly differentiated. The highest-grade tumors are termed undifferentiated.

Cancer cells are usually less developed (differentiated) than healthy cells, and not specialized for a specific task. Grading is done to assess how much the tumor cells differ from healthy cells. In many cases, the less differentiated tumor cells are, the faster they grow and the earlier they spread to surrounding tissue. Tumors are graded using the abbreviations G1 to G4: the higher the grade, the less differentiated and the more malignant the tumor is.

### 2.4.3 Staging Systems

The TNM Classification is a system for classifying a malignancy. It is primarily used in solid tumors and can assist in prognostic cancer staging. A standard classification system improves provider communication and facilitates information sharing and research across populations. The system is based on assessing the tumor, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis.

There is an international system for the classification of cancerous tumors. Known as TNM classification, it helps doctors and researchers to describe cancers and compare the results of medical tests and examinations. The abbreviation "TNM" stands for tumor (T), nodes (N), and metastases (M).

**TNM Components**

- **T (Tumor)**: Used to describe the size of the primary tumor and its invasion into adjacent tissues. T0 indicates no evidence of tumor is present, while T1-T4 is used to identify the size and extension of the tumor, with progressive enlargement and invasiveness from T1 to T4.

- **N (Nodes)**: Indicates whether or not the tumor has spread into nearby (regional) lymph nodes. These are lymph nodes that are located in the drainage area of the affected organ.

- **M (Metastases)**: Used to identify the presence of distant metastases of the primary tumor. Metastasis is when the tumor spreads beyond regional lymph nodes.

**Stage Grouping**

The TNM system helps to establish the anatomic extent of the disease, and the combination of the 3 factors can define the overall tumor stage. This method allows for simplification, with cancers staged from I-IV, with stage IV being the most severe stage. Stage 0 indicates carcinoma in situ, which is not considered cancerous but may become cancer.

Progressive cancer staging is associated with disease severity and decreased survival rates. Anal squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated an observed 5-year survival rate of 77% for stage I and only 15% for stage IV. Colorectal carcinoma demonstrated a 5-year survival rate of 74% for stage I but only 5% for stage IV.

### 2.4.4 Patterns of Metastatic Spread

When cancer cells replicate and divide, they don't behave like normal cells. For example, they don't "know" when to stop replicating and when to die. And they don't always stick together. This means that they might break away, move through the blood vessels or lymphatic system, and start growing somewhere else in the body. That is known as metastasis.

The general patterns of metastatic spread observed clinically include the following routes: hematogenous, lymphatic, transcoelomic, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The process of metastasis is complex and arduous, which incorporates multiple cells, factors and stages.

**Routes of Spread**

- **Hematogenous Spread**: Brain, bone, lung and liver are the most leading hematogenous sites from certain solid tumors.

- **Lymphatic Spread**: The lymphatic spread usually revolves around the ligaments and mesentery, and such dissemination can occur in non-Hodgkin lymphoma or neuroendocrine tumors.

- **Transcoelomic Spread**: In the case of peritoneal metastasis, malignant cells originating from primary abdominal organs usually spread through a transcoelomic mechanism.

**Common Metastatic Sites**

- Spinal metastases are the most common tumors of the spine, comprising approximately 90% of masses encountered with spinal imaging.
- The most common primary malignancies predominantly metastasizing to the spine include the following tumors in descending order: breast (21%), lung (19%), prostate (7.5%), renal (5%), gastrointestinal (4.5%), and thyroid (2.5%).

## 2.5 Epidemiology of Cancer

### 2.5.1 Global Cancer Burden

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, second only to heart disease in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 606,520 cancer deaths, and new cancer cases in 2020 were expected to exceed 1.8 million. Globally, nearly 20 million new cancer cases and almost 10 million deaths are reported annually.

In the first systematic collation of global high-quality cancer incidence data, in the 1960s, stomach cancer was the most common cancer type worldwide. Stomach cancer is now the fifth most common cancer type globally, with an estimated 1 million new cases in 2018 (5.7% of new cancer cases).

### 2.5.2 Risk Factors for Cancer

More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable. Much of the burden of cancer in the United States can be traced to modifiable health behaviors that increase one's risk of disease.

#### Major Modifiable Risk Factors

**Tobacco Use**

TOBACCO, through its various forms of exposure, constitutes the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide among men, and increasingly among women. Forms of exposure include active smoking, breathing secondhand tobacco smoke (passive or involuntary smoking) and smokeless tobacco.

Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women.

Current epidemiological evidence links tobacco use with several major cancers. Tobacco use causes cancers of the lung, oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, bladder, kidney, and pancreas and contributes to the risk of leukemia as well as cancers of the colon, stomach, cervix, and liver.

The total death toll in 2005 from tobacco use was estimated at 5.4 million people, including about 1.5 million cancer deaths. If present usage patterns continue, the overall number of tobacco-related deaths is projected to rise to about 6.4 million in 2015, including 2.1 million cancer deaths.

**Physical Inactivity, Diet, and Obesity**

PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, DIETARY FACTORS, OBESITY AND BEING OVERWEIGHT play an important role as causes of cancer. These factors are affected by gender norms. Because all these factors are intimately interconnected at the individual and contextual levels, estimating the specific contribution of each of these risk factors is difficult and might underestimate the cumulative potential risk.

Obesity increases the risk of breast, endometrial, colorectal, kidney, and esophageal cancer. Taken together, raised body mass index and physical inactivity account for an attributable fraction of 19% of breast cancer mortality, and 26% of colorectal cancer mortality. Overweight and obesity alone account for 40% of endometrial (uterus) cancer.

Nearly half of cancers—42 percent—are attributed to modifiable risk factors. For example, excess body fat is associated with 13 types of cancer and accounts for nearly 8 percent of cancer diagnoses. It has been estimated that excess body fat will surpass tobacco as the leading modifiable risk factor for cancer by 2030.

**Alcohol Consumption**

ALCOHOL USE is a risk factor for many cancer types including cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectum and breast. Risk of cancer increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.

Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity. In 2019, an estimated 96,730 cancer cases were related to alcohol consumption including 42,400 in men and 54,330 in women. This translates to nearly 1 million preventable cancer cases over ten years in the U.S.

There is convincing epidemiological evidence from both cohort and case-control studies that alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. All of the cohort studies that have examined this association, including those that controlled for smoking, have demonstrated a substantially increased risk.

In the U.S., there are about 20,000 alcohol-related cancer deaths annually. This is greater than the number of alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities (about 13,500 annually) in the U.S. Alcohol-related cancer deaths shorten the lives of those who die by an average of 15 years.

#### Environmental and Occupational Risk Factors

**Radiation Exposure**

RADIATION is energy emitted in the form of waves or rays. Ionizing radiation removes electrons from material (called ionization) when passing through cells and tissue, leading to cell or tissue injury. Ionizing radiation can cause almost any type of cancer, but particularly leukaemia, lung, thyroid and breast cancer.

Exposure to natural radiation is largely a result of radon gas in homes, which increases the risk of lung cancer. Non-ionizing radiation comprises electromagnetic fields like those emitted by mobile phones or power lines and ultraviolet radiation (mainly from the sun), the latter causing chromosomal damages. Ultraviolet radiation is a recognized cause of skin cancer including malignant melanomas.

**Occupational Exposures**

Occupational cancers are concentrated among specific groups of the working population, for whom the risk of developing a particular form of cancer may be much higher than for the general population. About 20–30% of the male and 5–20% of the female working-age population (people aged 15–64 years) may have been exposed to lung carcinogens during their working lives, accounting for about 10% of lung cancers worldwide. About 2% of leukaemia cases worldwide are attributable to occupational exposures.

**Infectious Agents**

Chronic HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infection (chronic hepatitis) causes about 52% of the world's hepatocellular carcinomas, resulting in nearly 340,000 deaths per year.

About one-quarter of cancers in low- and middle-income nations are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, which can cause stomach cancer; HPV, which can cause cervical, anal, throat, and penile cancer; and the hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause liver cancer. Most of these cancers could be prevented with vaccines and antivirals.

#### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors

**Age and Gender**

Cancer can result from abnormal proliferation of any of the different kinds of cells in the body, so there are more than a hundred distinct types of cancer, which can vary substantially in their behavior and response to treatment.

**Genetic Predisposition**

Compared with cancers arising in the general population, individuals with a major inherited predisposition to cancer are born with inherited (i.e., germline) mutations in genes involved in cancer causation, giving them a head start on the pathway to cancer.

### 2.5.3 Cancer Prevention and Screening

#### Primary Prevention

Cancer prevention is action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. In 2023, about 1.9 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer is lowered. Hopefully, this will reduce the burden of cancer and lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.

Cancer prevention methods include avoiding things that cause cancer, having a healthy lifestyle, getting screened, and using some medicines or surgery. Scientists are studying many different ways to help prevent cancer, including the following: Ways to avoid or control things known to cause cancer. Changes in diet and lifestyle. Finding precancerous conditions early.

**Lifestyle Modifications**

Most cancer risk factors are preventable. Measures such as eliminating tobacco products and secondhand smoke exposure, getting vaccinated (eg, against human papillomavirus or HPV), avoiding tanning beds, maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, abstaining from processed or red meat, and consuming high amounts of fruits and vegetables can substantially decrease a person's lifetime risk of developing cancer or dying from the condition.

A 19 percent decline in the rate at which new cancer cases occur and a 29 percent decline in the rate of cancer deaths could potentially be achieved by 2015 if efforts to help people change their behaviors that put them at risk were stepped up and if behavioral change were sustained.

Massetti stressed that 30 percent of cancer deaths globally are due to leading preventable risk factors such as obesity, lack of physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, exposure to radiation and other carcinogens, and some infections.

#### Secondary Prevention (Screening)

A complementary strategy to preventing the occurrence of cancer (primary prevention) is early detection of cancer through screening (secondary prevention). The fundamental tenet of screening for cancer is that finding the disease before symptoms develop enables detection at a less advanced stage and that instituting treatment at that time leads ultimately to improved health outcomes.

Cancer screening is essential for early detection and prevention. Fortunately, early screening for cancers such as colon, lung, cervical, breast, and prostate can delay or halt disease progression, increase cure rates, and reduce morbidity and mortality.

**Established Screening Programs**

**Breast Cancer Screening**

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. However, due to breast cancer screening, most cases are diagnosed at stage I, which has a 5-year survival rate of 100%. From 1989 to 2015, breast cancer mortality dropped by 39%.

According to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines, women aged 50 to 74 are recommended to undergo biennial mammography. For women aged 40 to 49, the decision to screen should be individualized, as the reduction in breast cancer deaths is smaller compared to the rate of false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.

Coverage of prevention services has expanded under Medicaid and Medicare, with the latter now covering annual mammography beginning at age 40, Pap smears and pelvic examinations, prostate cancer screening, and screening for colorectal cancer.

**Cervical Cancer Screening**

Of these, only breast mammography, the cervical PAP test, and colorectal FOB testing have been demonstrated to reduce site-specific cancer mortality when applied as a screening measure in the general population.

Since the early 1970s alone, the incidence and mortality for cervical cancer have dropped by approximately 40 percent, a decrease most likely due to increased screening by Pap tests and the use of effective treatment.

**Colorectal Cancer Screening**

Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common non-skin cancer in the United States after lung cancer in both men and women, with an annual incidence of 42.9 per 100,000 people. CRC accounts for 8% of cancer-related deaths in the US alone.

The USPSTF and many other expert councils recommend initiating screening for average-risk patients at 45 years of age due to high early-onset incidence. CRC screening options include an annual high-sensitivity fecal immunochemical test (FIT), an annual guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (g-FOBT), a multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, and computed tomography (CT) colonography every 5 years.

With the advent of newer and better screening tools, the CRC-related mortality rate has decreased, on average, by about 2.7% between 2004 and 2013. This number is expected to decrease further to about 38% for 50 to 74-year-olds and about 45% for those older than 75 by 2030.

**Lung Cancer Screening**

Past studies have shown that fully implementing screening in the target population, as described in the NLST trial, could prevent 12,250 lung cancer deaths annually. Patients should also participate in an informed, shared decision-making process regarding the benefits, harms, and limitations of LDCT screening and have access to a high-quality lung cancer screening and treatment center.

#### Challenges in Cancer Prevention and Screening

**Access and Implementation**

Screening programs can effectively reduce the burden of cancer if they ensure that people get the tests that they need and that tests are performed accurately, are not conducted too often, and are followed up in a timely and appropriate manner.

The principal challenges to optimizing the delivery of effective cancer screening services and reducing inappropriate testing lie in changing the behaviors of (1) systems of care, to make cancer screening services available to eligible populations; (2) health care providers, to perform cancer screening as recommended, on time, and with skill when they encounter patients eligible for screening; and (3) individuals, to obtain recommended screening tests and pursue follow-up tests.

**Barriers to Screening**

Work, school, or family responsibilities may make the tasks of scheduling and traveling to appointments, undergoing tests, and arranging and attending follow-up procedures too time-consuming or inconvenient. Physical limitations, such as those imposed by frail health in elderly individuals, may interfere with the ability to perform or undergo screening tests.

**Health Disparities**

Progress in cancer prevention and health promotion will require addressing social determinants of health, including the structural barriers to health. The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion is providing support to partnerships that emphasize community outreach and evidence-based interventions that address social determinants of health, with a particular focus on the risk factors of tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity, and alcohol use.

#### Future Directions in Cancer Prevention

**Personalized Prevention**

The search is now on for biologic markers that can indicate the presence of early carcinoma or that can be used as prognostic indicators to select patients for adjuvant therapies. These markers are usually substances produced by a cancer cell or by the host.

**Public Health Approaches**

Massetti emphasized that almost a third of cancer deaths globally are due to leading preventable risk factors like obesity, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use. "It is far easier and more effective to prevent cancer than to treat it," Massetti said.

**Global Perspectives**

Though cancer was once considered to be a problem primarily in wealthy nations, low- and middle-income countries now bear a majority share of the global cancer burden, and cancer often surpasses the burden of infectious diseases in these countries. Effective low-cost cancer control options are available for some malignancies, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that these interventions could facilitate the prevention of approximately one-third of cancer deaths worldwide.

## Summary

This chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of cancer as a disease of deregulation based exclusively on verified sources from NCBI Bookshelf. Cancer cells break the most basic rules of behavior by which multicellular organisms are built and maintained, and they exploit every kind of opportunity to do so.

Key principles that emerge from this exploration include:

1. **Cancer as Uncontrolled Growth**: Cancer begins when a cell breaks free from the normal restraints on cell division and begins to follow its own agenda for proliferation.

2. **Multistep Development**: Carcinogenesis can be divided conceptually into four steps: tumor initiation, tumor promotion, malignant conversion, and tumor progression.

3. **Hallmarks Framework**: The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumours. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease.

4. **Prevention Potential**: More than 90% of cancers are directly attributable to environmental and lifestyle factors, making them largely preventable.

5. **Historical Progress**: In the United States, a definitive effort to combat cancer and advance scientific research began with the establishment of the National Cancer Institute in 1937.

Understanding cancer as both a cellular and systemic disease provides the foundation for developing effective prevention, detection, and treatment strategies. The subsequent chapters will build upon this foundation to explore specific aspects of cancer biology, diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches, all grounded in evidence from authoritative medical literature.
