# Chapter 6: Tumor Suppressor Genes

## 6.1 Discovery and Function of Tumor Suppressor Genes

### 6.1.1 Historical Perspective and Discovery

The concept of tumor suppressor genes emerged from converging lines of evidence that challenged the prevailing oncogene-centric view of cancer development. The first insight into the activity of tumor suppressor genes came from somatic cell hybridization experiments, initiated by Henry Harris and his colleagues in 1969. The fusion of normal cells with tumor cells yielded hybrid cells containing chromosomes from both parents. In most cases, such hybrid cells were not capable of forming tumors in animals. Therefore, it appeared that genes derived from the normal cell parent acted to inhibit (or suppress) tumor development.

**Cell Fusion Studies**

The fusion of normal cells with tumor cells yielded hybrid cells containing chromosomes from both parents. In most cases, such hybrid cells were not capable of forming tumors in animals. Therefore, it appeared that genes derived from the normal cell parent acted to inhibit (or suppress) tumor development. These experiments provided the first functional evidence for the existence of genes that could suppress malignancy.

**The Two-Hit Hypothesis**

The molecular basis for tumor suppressor gene function was established through studies of retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor. Interestingly, about 60% of retinoblastomas occur sporadically (almost always in one eye), and these patients are not at increased risk for other forms of cancer. To explain this dichotomy, Knudson proposed a "two-hit" hypothesis: In the inherited form of retinoblastoma, children inherit one mutated RB allele (germ-line mutation), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal retinoblastoma (RB) allele undergoes a spontaneous somatic mutation; this is the "second hit." In sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, both normal RB alleles must undergo a somatic mutation in the same cell. The probability of this is low, which explains why retinoblastoma is uncommon in the general population.

**Molecular Identification of Tumor Suppressors**

The first tumor suppressor gene was identified by studies of retinoblastoma, a rare childhood eye tumor. Visible deletions of chromosome 13q14 were found in some retinoblastomas, suggesting that loss (rather than activation) of the Rb gene led to tumor development. Gene-mapping studies further indicated that tumor development resulted from loss of normal Rb alleles in the tumor cells, consistent with the function of Rb as a tumor suppressor gene. Isolation of the Rb gene as a molecular clone in 1986 then firmly established that Rb is consistently lost or mutated in retinoblastomas. Gene transfer experiments also demonstrated that introduction of a normal Rb gene into retinoblastoma cells reverses their tumorigenicity, providing direct evidence for the activity of Rb as a tumor suppressor.

Following the identification of RB1, the second tumor suppressor gene to have been identified is p53, which is frequently inactivated in a wide variety of human cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas and many other cancer types.

### 6.1.2 General Functions of Tumor Suppressor Genes

Tumor suppressor genes are important genes that act within the genome to regulate several cellular functions. These genes can be broadly classified based on their role in cell growth/cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, DNA repair mechanisms, and other crucial cellular signaling functions such as the apoptosis induction. Without functional tumor suppressor genes, there is a high risk of dysregulated cell growth that is a well-known mechanism for the development of cancers.

**Cell Cycle Regulation**

Two categories of genes play major roles in triggering cancer. In their normal forms, these genes control the cell cycle, the sequence of events by which cells enlarge and divide. One category of genes, called proto-oncogenes, encourages cell division. The other category, called tumor suppressor genes, inhibits it. Together, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes coordinate the regulated growth that normally ensures that each tissue and organ in the body maintains a size and structure that meets the body's needs.

**DNA Damage Response and Repair**

DNA repair pathway gene defects recently have been implicated in a fairly broad spectrum of human cancers. Like other tumor-suppressor genes, the DNA repair genes are inactivated in human cancers. However, because of their cellular function, it might be argued that they constitute a unique subset of the tumor-suppressor genes.

**Apoptosis Regulation**

A second cellular back-up system prompts a cell to commit suicide (undergo apoptosis) if some essential component is damaged or its control system is deregulated. This observation suggests that tumors arise from cells that have managed to evade such death. One way of avoiding apoptosis involves the p53 protein. In its normal form, this protein not only halts cell division, but induces apoptosis in abnormal cells. The product of a tumor suppressor gene, p53 is inactivated in many types of cancers.

### 6.1.3 Classification and Properties

Based on these original observations, there are three important properties of classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs): Classic tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are recessive at the cellular level, meaning that both copies must typically be inactivated for cancer to develop.

Cancer-critical genes in general can be classified into two groups, according to whether the dangerous mutations in them are those that cause loss of function or those that cause gain of function. Loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressor genes relieve cells of inhibitions that normally help to hold their numbers in check; gain-of-function mutations of proto-oncogenes stimulate cells to increase their numbers when they should not.

In the case of the tumor suppressor gene, on the other hand, the cancer-causing mutations are generally recessive: both copies of the normal gene must be removed or inactivated in the diploid somatic cell before an effect is seen. This calls for a different approach, to discover what is missing.

## 6.2 Mechanisms of Tumor Suppressor Inactivation

### 6.2.1 Overview of Inactivation Mechanisms

Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes can occur via epigenetic or genetic mechanisms. The reasons underlying this choice of gene inactivation routes during tumorigenesis have not been clarified, nor have the precise roles in cancer evolution for genes which are solely affected by epigenetically mediated loss of function.

In many tumors, these genes are lost or inactivated, thereby removing negative regulators of cell proliferation and contributing to the abnormal proliferation of tumor cells. Understanding the diverse mechanisms by which tumor suppressor genes are inactivated is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

### 6.2.2 Genetic Mechanisms of Inactivation

#### Classical Genetic Alterations

Loss of function of tumor-suppressor genes usually occurs in a bimodal fashion, and most frequently involves point mutations in one allele and loss of the second allele by a deletion, recombinational event, or chromosomal nondisjunction.

In inherited retinoblastoma, one defective copy of Rb is genetically transmitted. The loss of this single Rb copy is not by itself sufficient to trigger tumor development, but retinoblastoma almost always develops in these individuals as a result of a second somatic mutation leading to the loss of the remaining normal Rb allele. Noninherited retinoblastoma, in contrast, is rare, since its development requires two independent somatic mutations to inactivate both normal copies of Rb in the same cell.

#### Structural Chromosomal Alterations

Visible deletions of chromosome 13q14 were found in some retinoblastomas, suggesting that loss (rather than activation) of the Rb gene led to tumor development. Gene-mapping studies further indicated that tumor development resulted from loss of normal Rb alleles in the tumor cells, consistent with the function of Rb as a tumor suppressor gene.

Large-scale chromosomal deletions represent a major mechanism of tumor suppressor inactivation, often resulting in loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific tumor suppressor loci. These deletions can range from focal gene deletions to loss of entire chromosomal arms.

#### Point Mutations and Small Alterations

Point mutations affecting tumor suppressor genes include:

- **Nonsense mutations**: Creating premature stop codons
- **Missense mutations**: Altering protein function through amino acid substitutions
- **Frameshift mutations**: Resulting from insertions or deletions that disrupt the reading frame
- **Splice site mutations**: Affecting proper mRNA processing

### 6.2.3 Epigenetic Mechanisms of Inactivation

#### DNA Methylation

Cancer cells undergo many different alterations during their transformation, including genetic and epigenetic events. The controlled division of healthy cells can be impaired through the downregulation of tumour suppressor genes.

Epigenetic gene silencing refers to nonmutational gene inactivation that can be faithfully propagated from precursor cells to clones of daughter cells. The addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides in DNA is a biochemical modification that meets this requirement.

**CpG Island Hypermethylation**

Importantly, in many tumors, p16 is inactivated solely by DNA hypermethylation (i.e., both "hits" are epigenetic), and evidence is accumulating that this process begins quite early in tumor evolution. Assays performed by methylation-sensitive PCR on small tissue biopsies showed that p16 hypermethylation is detectable in preinvasive bronchial mucosal lesions occurring in smokers.

**Gene-Specific Methylation Patterns**

From the large number of examples, it should not be concluded that all proved or candidate TS genes undergo frequent methylation in cancer cells; some TS genes are detectably but infrequently methylated. The RB1 gene is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in some sporadic retinoblastomas, and historically this TS gene provided the first example of this pathway, but the incidence of its epigenetic silencing is only about 10%.

#### Histone Modifications

However, there are a number of universal aberrations common to all cancers, one of these being the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). The silencing of TSGs is thought to be an early, driving event in the oncogenic process.

The molecular mechanisms driving epigenetic silencing include:

1. **Ablation of transcription factor binding**
2. **Overexpression of DNA methyltransferases**
3. **Disruption of CTCF binding**
4. **Elevation of EZH2 histone methyltransferase**

#### Chromatin Remodeling

Beyond DNA methylation and histone modifications, chromatin remodeling complexes play critical roles in tumor suppressor gene silencing through their ability to alter nucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility. Chromatin remodeling involves ATP-dependent enzymatic complexes that reorganize nucleosome structure, thereby modulating access of transcriptional machinery to DNA and influencing gene expression.

**SWI/SNF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes:**

The SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling enzymes represents a major class of factors involved in both gene activation and repression. These ATP-dependent complexes use energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA contacts, slide nucleosomes along DNA, or evict nucleosomes entirely, thereby altering chromatin structure. Importantly, histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling genes themselves can function as tumor suppressor genes, and their inactivation through genetic mutations or epigenetic alterations during cancer pathogenesis causes perturbation of broad or genome-wide gene expression profiles.

**HELLS (Helicase, Lymphoid-Specific):**

One example of a chromatin remodeling enzyme implicated in tumor suppressor silencing is HELLS, an SWI2/SNF2 family member that is remarkably overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Overexpression of HELLS correlates with more aggressive clinicopathological features and poorer patient prognosis. Mechanistically, up-regulation of HELLS confers transcription factor SP1 hyperactivation, leading to epigenetic silencing of multiple tumor suppressor genes through altered chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning. HELLS alters nucleosome occupancy at putative enhancers and modulates binding of lineage-specific transcription factors, thereby regulating the chromatin landscape in ways that can silence tumor suppressors.

**Interconnection of Chromatin Remodeling with Other Epigenetic Mechanisms:**

Chromatin remodeling does not occur in isolation but rather functions in concert with DNA methylation and histone modifications to establish and maintain gene silencing. Transcriptional activators and repressors recruit both histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling complexes that can remodel chromatin, ultimately changing the transcriptional activity of genes. For example:

- Chromatin remodeling complexes facilitate access of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to target promoters
- Histone-modifying enzymes (histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases) are recruited alongside chromatin remodelers to establish repressive chromatin states
- The coordinated action of chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, and DNA methylation creates stable epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes

**Clinical Implications:**

The recognition that chromatin regulators possess tumor suppressor properties and are frequently disrupted in human cancers has opened therapeutic avenues. Drugs targeting chromatin remodeling machinery, including inhibitors of specific histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodeling factors, are being developed as novel cancer therapies. Understanding how chromatin structure changes contribute to tumor suppressor silencing provides opportunities for epigenetic therapies that can potentially reverse these alterations and restore tumor suppressor function.

### 6.2.4 Viral Mechanisms of Inactivation

In addition, as noted earlier in this chapter, the Rb protein is a key target for the oncogene proteins of several DNA tumor viruses, including SV40, adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses, which bind to Rb and inhibit its activity. Transformation by these viruses thus results, at least in part, from inactivation of Rb at the protein level rather than from mutational inactivation of the Rb gene.

### 6.2.5 Clinical Examples of Inactivation Mechanisms

#### p16/CDKN2A Inactivation

The p16 gene resides on chromosome 9p in a region that is subject to frequent deletion or LOH in various human cancers. This gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that restrains the cell cycle by preventing phosphorylation and inactivation of Rb.

#### MLH1 in Colorectal Cancer

In all of these series, strong correlations emerged between promoter hypermethylation, loss of hMLH1 protein, and the MIN phenotype. Gene specificity of the epigenetic silencing was observed in each of these tumor types, as hypermethylation of MSH2 was not detected in any of several studies.

## 6.3 Key Tumor Suppressor Genes

### 6.3.1 TP53: Guardian of the Genome

The p53 gene like the Rb gene, is a tumor suppressor gene, i.e., its activity stops the formation of tumors. If a person inherits only one functional copy of the p53 gene from their parents, they are predisposed to cancer and usually develop several independent tumors in a variety of tissues in early adulthood. This condition is rare, and is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. However, mutations in p53 are found in most tumor types, and so contribute to the complex network of molecular events leading to tumor formation.

**Structure and Function**

The p53 gene has been mapped to chromosome 17. In the cell, p53 protein binds DNA, which in turn stimulates another gene to produce a protein called p21 that interacts with a cell division-stimulating protein (cdk2). When p21 is complexed with cdk2 the cell cannot pass through to the next stage of cell division. Mutant p53 can no longer bind DNA in an effective way, and as a consequence the p21 protein is not made available to act as the 'stop signal' for cell division.

**Role in DNA Damage Response**

The p53 tumor-suppressor gene is central in the response pathway to cellular stress. For example, DNA damage caused by chemical carcinogens activates the p53 tumor-suppressor protein by posttranslational modification to transduce signals to "guard the genome" by engaging cell-cycle checkpoints and enhancing DNA repair, and as a fail-safe mechanism, to cause replicative senescence or apoptotic death. Mutations in the p53 gene or inactivation of its encoded protein by viral oncoproteins generally lead to a loss of these cellular defense functions.

**Clinical Significance**

Most of the cancers demonstrate a biallelic loss-of-function mutation in TP53. Uncommon patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a very high incidence of a wide variety of cancers like breast cancer, soft-tissue, and bone sarcomas, and brain tumors since they inherit one defective copy of TP53.

### 6.3.2 RB1: Master Regulator of the Cell Cycle

The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) was the first tumor suppressor gene to be identified and serves as the prototypical example of Knudson's two-hit hypothesis.

**Normal Function**

Although Rb was identified in a rare childhood cancer, it is also involved in some of the more common tumors of adults. In particular, studies of the cloned gene have established that Rb is lost or inactivated in many bladder, breast, and lung carcinomas. The significance of the Rb tumor suppressor gene thus extends beyond retinoblastoma, apparently contributing to development of a substantial fraction of more common human cancers.

**Viral Inactivation**

In addition, as noted earlier in this chapter, the Rb protein is a key target for the oncogene proteins of several DNA tumor viruses, including SV40, adenoviruses, and human papillomaviruses, which bind to Rb and inhibit its activity. Transformation by these viruses thus results, at least in part, from inactivation of Rb at the protein level rather than from mutational inactivation of the Rb gene.

### 6.3.3 BRCA1 and BRCA2: Guardians of Genomic Integrity

BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and male breast cancer, ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers), and to a lesser extent other cancers such as prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2 pathogenic variant.

**Molecular Functions**

The BRCA1/BARD1 protein complex enhances ubiquitin ligase activity, which is associated with the regulation of centrosome function and involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. BRCA1 colocalizes with BRCA2 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage and activates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks. BRCA2 regulates the availability and activity of RAD51, which coats single-strand DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament that invades and pairs with a homologous DNA duplex.

**DNA Repair Functions**

Subsequent transducers and effectors include the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex (both transducer and effector), and the breast cancer susceptibility proteins BRCA1 (a transducer) and BRCA2 (an effector). BRCA2 interacts directly with DNA and the Rad51 strand-transferase to help initiate homologous recombination.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for efficient HRR (homologous recombinational repair), but the precise biochemical role for BRCA1 remains unclear.

**Clinical Implications**

Several lines of investigation have implicated BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DNA damage-response pathways. An association between BRCA1 and p53 and the subsequent enhancement of p53 activity incriminates BRCA1 in p21-mediated cell-cycle arrest following DNA damage. In addition, BRCA1 forms complexes with both BRCA2 and Rad51, the human homolog of the Escherichia coli gene RecA, which is essential to normal recombination and genome stability.

**Therapeutic Targeting**

PARP inhibitors have emerged as a promising treatment in individuals with BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer, given their role in DNA repair. Because BRCA1, BRCA2, and PARP participate in DNA repair, their mutual disruption could lead to "synergistic lethality" of tumor cells.

### 6.3.4 APC: The Colorectal Cancer Gatekeeper

The APC gene is large, with more than 15 exons, and alternative splicing affects the 5′ untranslated portion of transcripts. The predominant APC transcript encodes a 2,843-amino-acid protein expressed in many adult tissues.

**Role in Colorectal Cancer**

Among the earliest and most common events in the colorectal tumor progression pathway is loss or pathogenic variant–inactivation of the APC gene. APC mutations have been reported in up to 80% of adenomas and in up to 80% of carcinomas. Functionally, the APC gene is involved in the wingless/Wnt signaling pathway.

**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis**

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant polyposis syndrome characterized by varying degrees of penetrance. The primary genetic defect associated with this disorder is a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene.

If left untreated, affected individuals develop hundreds to thousands of polyps throughout the colon and rectum, often manifesting in the early teenage years. This condition ultimately results in an almost 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer, typically occurring by age 40.

**Molecular Function**

The APC gene on chromosome 5q21 encodes a 2,843-amino acid protein that is important in cell adhesion and signal transduction; the main function of the APC protein is to regulate intracellular concentrations of beta-catenin, a major mediator of the Wnt signal transduction pathway.

The APC protein is now known to be an inhibitory component of the Wnt signaling pathway. It acts by binding to β-catenin, another component of the pathway, and thereby preventing activation of TCF4, a gene regulatory protein that stimulates growth of the colonic epithelium when it has β-catenin bound to it.

### 6.3.5 PTEN: A Phosphatase with Broad Tumor Suppressive Functions

The PTEN gene, located on chromosome 10q23, is missing or mutated in a variety of human cancers, including glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer), endometrial (uterine) tumors, and prostate cancer, as well as in Cowden disease cells.

**Molecular Function**

The PTEN tumor suppressor gene acts as a phospholipid phosphatase. Under normal growth conditions, stimulatory signals from the insulin receptor activate the enzyme phosphoinositide kinase (PI3-kinase), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate PIP3, a key second messenger.

PTEN belongs to a subclass of phosphatases called dual-specificity phosphatases that remove phosphate groups from tyrosine as well as serine and threonine. In addition, PTEN is the major phosphatase for phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate, and thus downregulates the PI3K/AKT pathway.

If PTEN fails to deactivate PIP3 because of a mutation in its phosphatase domain, downstream signals are not switched off, and therefore PKB/Akt remains in the "on" state. In this case, PKB/Akt can continue to stimulate downstream proteins such as transcription factors and glucose transporters, which could lead to enhanced cell growth.

**PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome**

The PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) includes Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), PTEN-related Proteus syndrome (PS), and PTEN-related Proteus-like syndrome. CS is a multiple hamartoma syndrome with a high risk for benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid, breast, kidney, and endometrium.

Autosomally dominant inherited mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN are responsible for Cowden disease. The protein encoded by the PTEN gene contributes to the control of apoptosis and the cell cycle. Specifically, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is down-regulated by the PTEN gene product, resulting in decreased cellular proliferation and survival.

## 6.4 Clinical Implications of Tumor Suppressors

### 6.4.1 Hereditary Cancer Syndromes

Loss of function mutations in tumor suppressor genes has been identified in many types of cancers, including ovarian, lung, colorectal, head and neck, pancreatic, uterine, breast, and bladder cancer. There are even familial cancer syndromes associated with the loss of function germline mutations of specific tumor suppressor genes like Li-Fraumeni syndrome with the loss of TP53.

#### Li-Fraumeni Syndrome

Uncommon patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a very high incidence of a wide variety of cancers like breast cancer, soft-tissue, and bone sarcomas, and brain tumors since they inherit one defective copy of TP53.

#### BRCA-Associated Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer

The Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have well established roles in the maintenance of genomic stability. Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been strongly associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

### 6.4.2 Therapeutic Targeting of Tumor Suppressors

#### PARP Inhibitors and Synthetic Lethality

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are key tumor suppressor genes that are essential for the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. Loss of function mutations in these genes result in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes, which comprise approximately 5% of cases. The concept of synthetic lethality led to the development of PARP inhibitors which cause cell cytotoxicity via the inhibition of PARP1, a key DNA repair protein, in cells with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.

**Mechanism of Action**

In these cells, if PARP1 is inhibited, the cell loses its ability to repair single-strand DNA breaks via BER. When the replication fork reaches an area with a single-strand break, a double-strand break results. These double-strand breaks are then unable to be repaired because of the BRCA1I2 mutation impairing HR As a result, the BRCA-mutated cells undergo apoptosis, whereas normal cells with intact BRCA are able to repair the double-strand DNA lesions and survive.

**Clinical Success of PARP Inhibitors**

PARP inhibitors are a class of agents that have shown significant preclinical activity in models defective in homologous recombination (HR). The identification of synthetic lethality between HR defects and PARP inhibition led to several clinical trials in tumors with known HR defects (initially mutations in BRCA1/2 genes and subsequently in other genes involved in HR).

Four PARPi (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and talazoparib) are now approved in the clinic with different indications mainly in BRCA1/2 mutated/HRD tumors, including ovarian carcinoma, breast, and pancreatic with very interesting results.

#### Combination Therapy Approaches

Several clinical trials are currently underway investigating the effects of PARP inhibitors in combination with PD-1 inhibitors. Results from a Phase I study were 49 patient's suffering from solid tumors were treated with a combination of a PARPi and Tislelizumab showed 20% of patients achieved an objective response.

**Overcoming Resistance**

More than 40% BRCA1/2-deficient patients fail to respond to PARPi. In addition, lots of patients acquire PARPi resistance with prolonged oral administration of PARPi. Homologous recombination repair deficient (HRD), as an essential prerequisite of synthetic lethality, plays a vital role in killing tumor cells.

#### p53-Targeted Therapies

The protein MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog) is a negative regulator of p53. Several compounds have been developed to specifically target protein-protein interactions between p53 and MDM2. The first molecule in this category is nutlin, which has been identified in several large in vitro biochemical screens as a molecule that inhibits interaction between p53 and MDM2 by occupying the p53-binding pocket.

### 6.4.3 Biomarker Development and Precision Medicine

#### Homologous Recombination Deficiency Testing

Since their approval in 2014, significant efforts have been made to establish validated biomarkers for PARPi sensitivity, but with little success. As such, germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations remain the main predictive biomarkers for the majority of PARP inhibitors. However, in 2019, a Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) assay was approved as biomarker for the use of Niraparib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

#### Expanding Beyond BRCA

The list of potential candidates for a synthetic lethal approach most likely extends beyond patients with familial BRCA syndromes. Some sporadic (nonfamilial) breast and ovarian cancers are now recognized to harbor de novo mutations or promoter hypermethylation in BRCA1/2.

### 6.4.4 Diagnostic Applications

#### Methylation-Based Diagnostics

Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) has been demonstrated in epithelial origin tumors. Four TSGs were frequently hypermethylated in 86 metastatic tumor specimens: retinoic acid receptor-beta2 (RAR-beta2) (70%), RAS association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1A) (57%), and O6-methylguanine DNA methylatransferase (MGMT) (34%), and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) (19%).

#### Liquid Biopsy Applications

Besides, the technology-driven liquid biopsy biomarker is very promising to improve patients' survival. Circulating tumor DNA analysis for tumor suppressor gene mutations represents a promising non-invasive diagnostic approach.

### 6.4.5 Therapeutic Resistance and Adaptation

#### Epigenetic Therapy Limitations

Epigenetic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, in contrast to gene mutations, can be modulated or reversed by small molecules. This has lead to several recent studies of drugs targeting epigenetic mechanisms as novel cancer therapies. So far, epigenetic therapies, including HDAC inhibitors and demethylating agents, show considerable activity in haematological malignancies, but their value in the treatment of solid tumours remains much more uncertain.

## 6.5 Future Directions 

### 6.5.1 Advanced Molecular Profiling Technologies

#### Multi-Omics Approaches

Next-generation DNA sequencing technology has dramatically advanced clinical oncology through the identification of therapeutic targets and molecular biomarkers, leading to the personalization of cancer treatment with significantly improved outcomes for many common and rare tumor entities.

The traditional mechanism-driven functional biomarkers have the advantage of actionable insights, while data-driven computational biomarkers can fulfill more needs, especially with tremendous data on the molecules of different layers (e.g. genetic mutation, mRNA, protein etc.) which are accumulated based on a plenty of technologies.

#### Comprehensive Genomic Profiling

Looking to the future, advanced omics technologies and computational techniques will enable assessment of not only genomic variants, as performed today, but also of pathway and network aberrations that will greatly facilitate selection of drug combinations likely to benefit specific patients.

### 6.5.2 Precision Medicine Applications

#### Biomarker-Driven Treatment Selection

During the period of 2011-2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) granted 139 accelerated and 329 regular approvals for 86 and 152 cancer therapeutic products, respectively. The percentage of approvals for a biomarker-defined population was numerically higher in accelerated approvals in comparison to regular approvals, that is, 48% vs. 40%.

Personalized or Precision medicine (PM) is a promising approach for the cancer treatment that tailors treatment to a patient's characteristics. Biomarkers are crucial for identifying the patients who are expected to derive greatest advantage from targeted therapy.

#### Expanding Therapeutic Targets

Over the years, approvals were incorporating a more diverse collection of distinct biomarkers, from 3 in 2011 to 16 in 2022. Overall, HER2, hormone receptor (HR), EGFR, ALK, BRAF, and PD-L1-defined populations received the highest numbers of approvals.

### 6.5.3 Novel Therapeutic Strategies

#### Combination Therapy Development

Recently, a growing body of evidence indicated that a broader population of patients could benefit from PARPi therapy far beyond those with germline BRCA1/2 mutated tumors. Numerous biomarkers including homologous recombination deficiency and high level of replication pressure also herald high sensitivity to PARPi treatment.

Besides, a series of studies indicated that PARPi-involved combination therapy such as PARPi with additional chemotherapy therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, as well as targeted agent had a great advantage in overcoming PARPi resistance and enhancing PARPi efficacy.

#### Synthetic Lethality Beyond BRCA

The interaction between BRCA and PARP is a form of synthetic lethal effect which means the simultaneously functional loss of two genes lead to cell death, while defect in any single gene has a slight effect on cell viability.

Furthermore, the combination of PARP inhibitors with drugs that indirectly interfere with HR, such as VEGFR, BRD4, EZH2, HDAC, and PD-L1 inhibitors, results in synthetic lethality in BRCA1/2 wild-type tumors, expanding the scope of PARP inhibitor applications.

### 6.5.4 Emerging Technologies and Approaches

#### Functional Assays for Tumor Suppressor Activity

The increasing availability of tests to determine the status of HR beyond BRCA1/2 and other known gene mutations, together with the introduction of functional tests that can easily identify defective tumors, will certainly increase the population of patients who can potentially benefit from PARPi.

#### Liquid Biopsy Advancements

The traditional mechanism-driven functional biomarkers have the advantage of actionable insights, while data-driven computational biomarkers can fulfill more needs, especially with tremendous data on the molecules of different layers (e.g. genetic mutation, mRNA, protein etc.) which are accumulated based on a plenty of technologies.

### 6.5.5 Challenges and Future Opportunities

#### Precision Medicine Implementation

There are several hurdles in use of PM in oncology, such as the complexity of tumor biology and heterogeneity, limited availability of biomarkers, high cost of targeted therapies, resistance to targeted therapies, and ethical and social issues.

#### Integration of Multiple Data Types

Current developments on mechanisms-, data- and technology-driven biomarker discovery are achieving the aim of precision medicine and promoting the clinical application of biomarkers. Meanwhile, the complexity of cancer requires more effective biomarkers, which could be accomplished by a comprehensive integration of multiple types of biomarkers together with a deep understanding of cancer.

### 6.5.6 Therapeutic Resistance and Adaptation

#### Understanding Resistance Mechanisms

Unfortunately, as with many anti-cancer agents, drugs used to treat patients carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation create a selective pressure, and over time tumors can become drug resistant.

Current BRCAnalysis assay could not effectively identify BRCAness. For example, genomic scars of BRCAness, as they are currently measured, probably reflect the alteration of the genome in the absence of HR over the entire lifetime of a tumor, they might not provide an accurate estimation of whether HR is still defective in tumor cells at the time that treatment is delivered.

#### Strategies to Overcome Resistance

To enhance PARPi sensitivity and overcome PARPi resistance, several feasible strategies should be considered and implemented in the future: 1) PARPi-oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) combination; oHSVs, approved by FDA for recurrent melanoma, are genetically engineered to selectively kill cancer cells, due to their characteristics of amplifying and spreading within the tumor but not normal tissue.

### 6.5.7 Future Paradigms in Cancer Treatment

#### Precision Oncology Evolution

As our deepening understanding of tumor biology converges with rapid advances in measurement science and technology and computational analysis, we have an enormous opportunity to create a future for precision medicine in oncology that provides for highly specific, minimally toxic, and dramatically effective treatment for each patient.

The integration of cancer biomarkers into oncology has revolutionized cancer treatment, yielding remarkable advancements in cancer therapeutics and the prognosis of cancer patients. The development of personalized medicine represents a turning point and a new paradigm in cancer management, as biomarkers enable oncologists to tailor treatments based on the unique molecular profile of each patient's tumor.

#### Immunotherapy Integration

Melanoma, a disease once largely untreatable when metastatic, may be a paradigm for understanding how the molecular drivers of a disease can lead to highly effective targeted therapies, as well as for realizing the enormous therapeutic potential of unleashing the immune system against cancer to produce long-term disease control.

### 6.5.8 Research Infrastructure and Data Integration

#### Comprehensive Data Analysis

This progress is primarily attributed to the biological characterization of cancers, advancements in testing methodologies, elucidation of the immune microenvironment, and the ability to profile circulating tumor fractions. Integrating these insights promises to continually advance the precision oncology field, fostering better patient outcomes.

#### Technology-Driven Discovery

Breast cancer has become the prototypical solid tumor where targets have been identified within the tumor allowing for personalized approach for systemic therapy. Biomarkers are beginning to play an important role in preparing the way for precision treatment.

### 6.5.9 Therapeutic Development Pipeline

#### Expanding Treatment Options

Extensive research is underway to understand these genes and their relationship to cancers to facilitate the development of targeted therapies and identify patients who might benefit from them.

DNA damage repair deficiency leads to the increased risk of genome instability and oncogenic transformation. In the meanwhile, this deficiency could be exploited for cancer treatment by inducing excessive genome instability and catastrophic DNA damage.

The future of tumor suppressor research lies in the integration of advanced molecular technologies, comprehensive biomarker development, and the continued refinement of precision medicine approaches that can translate our understanding of tumor suppressor biology into improved patient outcomes.

## Conclusion

A current view is that cancers arise through a multistage process in which inherited and somatic mutations of cellular genes lead to clonal selection of variant progeny with the most robust and aggressive growth properties. Two classes of genes, protooncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, are targets for the mutations.

The study of tumor suppressor genes has revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology and continues to provide insights into cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. These mutations occur in genes that control cell growth and cell death. The activation of protooncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes are mutational events that drive the multistep process of carcinogenesis.
