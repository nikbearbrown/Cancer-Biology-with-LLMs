# Chapter 27: Nanotechnology in Cancer

Nanotechnology has emerged as a revolutionary approach in oncology, offering unprecedented opportunities to address the fundamental challenges of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The intrinsic limits of conventional cancer therapies prompted the development and application of various nanotechnologies for more effective and safer cancer treatment. Cancer nanomedicine represents the convergence of nanotechnology, molecular biology, and clinical oncology, creating multifunctional platforms that can simultaneously target, diagnose, and treat malignancies with enhanced precision and reduced toxicity.

The ultimate goal of nanomedicine has always been the generation of translational technologies that can ameliorate current therapies. Cancer disease represented the primary target of nanotechnology applied to medicine, since its clinical management is characterized by very toxic therapeutics. The unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, particularly their size-dependent behavior and ability to exploit tumor pathophysiology, have created new paradigms for drug delivery, imaging, and combination therapies.

The field encompasses diverse nanoplatforms including organic nanoparticles (NPs) such as liposomes and polymeric systems, inorganic NPs including quantum dots and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and hybrid systems that combine the advantages of multiple materials. Organic NPs have been vastly explored for several years and fabricated with organic compounds like lipids, protein, carbohydrates, and other organic compounds. Polymer-based NPs, liposome-based NPs, and dendrimers are extensively used as organic NPs in cancer treatment.

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of nanotechnology applications in cancer, focusing on drug delivery systems, imaging modalities, and theranostic platforms that integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities within single nanoformulations.

## 27.1 Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery

Nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative approach in cancer treatment, offering unprecedented opportunities to overcome the limitations of conventional therapeutic modalities. Cancer nanotherapeutics are rapidly progressing and are being implemented to solve several limitations of conventional drug delivery systems such as nonspecific biodistribution and targeting, lack of water solubility, poor oral bioavailability, and low therapeutic indices.

### 27.1.1 Fundamentals of Nanoparticle Drug Delivery

**Enhanced Permeability and Retention Effect**

Jhaveri and Vladimir P. Torchilin Front. Pharmacol., Volume 5 - 2014 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2014.00077 via Wikimedia Commons </small></em></p>

Nanoparticles exploit the unique pathophysiology of tumors, particularly the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon arises from:

* **Abnormal tumor vasculature**: Tumor blood vessels are typically more permeable than normal vessels due to incomplete endothelial cell junctions and reduced pericyte coverage
* **Defective lymphatic drainage**: Impaired lymphatic function in tumors leads to reduced clearance of extravasated materials
* **Size-dependent accumulation**: Nanoparticles in the optimal size range (10-150 nm) can extravasate through leaky tumor vasculature while being retained in the tumor microenvironment

**Passive vs. Active Targeting**

*Passive Targeting*:
* Relies on the EPR effect for tumor accumulation
* Size and surface characteristics determine circulation time and biodistribution
* Stealth properties achieved through polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating to evade immune recognition

*Active Targeting*:
* Employs specific ligands or antibodies directed against tumor-specific receptors
* Amplifies specificity of therapeutic nanoparticles
* Enhances cellular uptake and internalization by cancer cells

### 27.1.2 Types of Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Systems

**Liposomal Drug Delivery Systems**

Liposomes are lipid spheres about 100 nanometers in diameter that have been synthesized for improved delivery of therapeutic agents. Liposome, the first nano-scale drug approved for clinical application, consists of an outer lipid layer and a core entrapping either hydrophobic or hydrophilic drug. They offer several advantages:

* **Biocompatibility**: Composed of naturally occurring lipids
* **Versatile drug loading**: Can encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs
* **Controlled release**: Permit continued drug release with increased precision in tumor-targeting
* **Reduced toxicity**: Demonstrated clinical success in reducing systemic toxicity

  <div align="center">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong> Figure 27.2 Schematic representation of the different types of liposomal drug delivery systems. </strong>   <small> Source: Sercombe, Veerati, Moheimani, Wu, Sood and Hua Front. Pharmacol., Volume 6 - 2015 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2015.00286 via Wikimedia Commons </small></em></p>

*Advanced Liposomal Formulations*:
The PEG (polyethylene glycol) is a hydrophilic polymer that prevents the liposome from recognizing subsequent clearance. Improved pharmacokinetic characteristics, regulated and prolonged drug release, and, most importantly, decreased systemic toxicity are all provided by LNPs. Modern liposomal systems include:

- **PEGylated liposomes**: Enhanced circulation time and reduced immunogenicity
- **Targeted liposomes**: Surface-modified with antibodies or ligands for active targeting
- **Stimuli-responsive liposomes**: pH, temperature, or enzyme-triggered drug release
- **Combination liposomes**: Co-delivery of multiple therapeutic agents

*Clinical Applications*:
In the field of breast and prostate cancer, the application of liposomes has been increasingly common. Multiple paclitaxel liposomes have been demonstrated to have higher anti-tumor efficiency and improved bioavailability compared to free paclitaxel. Liposomes have been used to encapsulate anticancer drugs for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. In melanoma models, phosphatidylethanolamine liposomal cisplatin was proven to have higher cytotoxicity than classic liposomes or free cisplatin, maintaining high intratumoral drug concentration for 72 hours and efficiently delivering 3.6-times more drug compared to the free drug.

**Polymeric Nanoparticles**

Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) play an important role in controlled cancer drug delivery. Anticancer drugs can be conjugated or encapsulated by polymeric nanocarriers, which are known as polymeric nanomedicine. Polymeric nanoparticles (PNs) are molecules usually organized with tunable size into a dense structure with entangling biodegradable polymers presenting thermodynamic stability in an aqueous solvent. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has approved three PNs: polylactic acid (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and polycaprolactone (PCL).

*Advantages*:
Due to their nature, they make possible the customization of many properties, such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight and biodegradability. All of them are completely biocompatible and biodegradable, and have acknowledged degradation curves, making the drug release process of these nanocarriers more accessible to be customized

- Controlled drug release kinetics
- Biodegradable and biocompatible
- Tunable surface properties through copolymer modification
- Protection of encapsulated drugs from degradation

*Advanced Polymeric Systems*:

**Polymersomes**: Polymersomes are a kind of supramolecular aggregates formed by the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules. As drug carriers, polymersomes modify the distribution of drugs in body, prevent drug degradation and inactivation, extend the action time of drugs, and reduce side effects. These vesicular structures offer:

- Superior stability compared to liposomes
- Controllable membrane thickness and permeability
- Ability to deliver both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs
- Stimuli-responsive capabilities including pH, temperature hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, light, and so on

**Polymeric Micelles**: 

<div align="center">

  </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong> Figure 27.3 Micelle formation </strong>  Drug-loaded polymeric micelle formed from self -assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers in aqueous media. <small> Source: Aditi M. Jhaveri and Vladimir P. Torchilin Front. Pharmacol., Volume 5 - 2014 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2014.00077 via Wikimedia Commons</small></em></p>

Self-assembled structures from amphiphilic block copolymers that provide:

- Enhanced solubilization of hydrophobic drugs
- Core-shell architecture for drug encapsulation
- Active targeting through surface modification
- Improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution

*Clinical Success*:
Albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel NPs (Abraxane®) were approved in 2012 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer treatment. It has been used since then for the treatment of a large list of cancer including non-small cell lung carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.

*PEGylation Strategy*:
Copolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been used to reduce degradation rate and improve biocompatibility, creating PLA-PEG and PLGA-PEG formulations that evade immune response and extend circulation time.

**Hybrid Nanoparticles**

Hybrid NPs combine the advantages of different NPs, thereby enhancing the function and stability of each drug delivery system. These advanced systems represent the next generation of nanomedicine platforms.

*Lipid-Polymer Hybrid Nanoparticles (LPHNPs)*:
LPHNPs are advanced core–shell nanoconstructs with a polymeric core region enclosed by a lipidic layer, presumed to be derived from both liposomes and polymeric nanounits. Key advantages include:

- High biocompatibility of lipids with the structural integrity provided by polymer NPs, capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs
- Stability, high loading of cargo, increased biocompatibility, rate-limiting controlled release, and elevated drug half-lives as well as therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing their drawbacks
- Effective internalization by cancer cells and avoidance of fast clearance by the reticuloendothelial system

*Clinical Applications of Hybrid Systems*:
Lipid-polymer hybrid NPs have been demonstrated to be a promising drug delivery platform in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and metastatic prostate cancer.

*Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Nanoparticles*:
The combination of organic and inorganic hybrid nano-materials is a common method of NP design. For example, a liposome-silica hybrid (LSH) nanoparticle consists of a silica core and a surrounding lipid layer.

**Carbon-Based Nanoparticles**

Carbon-based nanoparticles are effective in melanoma cells. A single-walled carbon nanotube loaded with doxorubicin induced melanoma cell death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and reduced tumor development in a xenograft melanoma model.

*Properties*:
* High surface area for drug loading
* Excellent electrical and thermal conductivity
* Potential for photothermal therapy applications
* Challenges with biocompatibility and clearance

**Inorganic Nanoparticles**

*Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs)*:
Gold nanoparticles are known as nontoxic, highly stable, easy to synthesize, and minimally interfering with the biological profile of melanoma tumor cells. Being of high atomic number and electron density, GNPs are optimal contrast agents for computed tomography.

*Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSNPs)*:
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles have high drug loading due to high pore volume and surface area, multifunctionalization for targeted and controlled delivery, enhanced cellular uptake and delivers therapeutics at cellular levels in cancer.

*Magnetic Nanoparticles*:
* Iron oxide nanoparticles for MRI contrast enhancement
* Potential for magnetic hyperthermia therapy
* Targeted delivery using external magnetic fields

### 27.1.3 Overcoming Drug Resistance

**Mechanisms of Drug Resistance**

The mechanisms of cancer drug resistance include overexpression of drug efflux transporters, defective apoptotic pathways, and hypoxic environment. Cancer drug resistance represents one of the most significant challenges in oncology, with over 50% of the anticancer drugs used in the clinic today targeted by P-glycoprotein (P-gp).

**ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters**:
A distinct and predominant mechanism of drug resistance found in cancer cells is the overexpression of specific efflux pumps. These efflux pumps are part of the ABC superfamily of transporters and can translocate substrates (drugs) from the inside to the outside of the cell, thereby reducing intracellular drug accumulation. Key resistance mechanisms include:

- **P-glycoprotein (P-gp)**: P-gp can efflux various anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel out of cancer cells. Overexpression of P-gp is a common feature of most acquired MDR (Multidrug Resistance) in solid tumors
- **Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 1 (MRP1)**: Contributes to drug efflux and resistance
- **Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP)**: Another major efflux transporter

**Nanoparticle-Based Solutions**

*Bypassing Efflux Pumps*:
Considering different mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer, nanoparticles are always designed to inhibit or bypass efflux pumps on the membrane or to enhance endocytosis when recognizing MDR tumors. Strategies include:

- **Endocytic Uptake**: Nanoparticles targeting these mechanisms can lead to an improvement in the reversal of multidrug resistance
- **Co-delivery Systems**: Nano-codelivery systems that can transport traditional chemotherapy drugs and multiple MDR transporter inhibitors. These systems function by interfering with the "efflux pump" functions of cell membrane transporters
- **Size-dependent Mechanisms**: Nanoparticles can deliver drugs directly to intracellular compartments, bypassing membrane transporters

*Multi-compound Nanoparticles*:
Nanoparticles capable to encapsulate or bind multiple compounds at once and release the drugs at the target site either simultaneously or in a predetermined sequence. A novel polymer lipid hybrid nanoparticle (PLN) system was able to circumvent drug resistance. Dox-MMC co-loaded PLN were 20-30-folds more effective in killing MDR cells than free drugs.

*Gene Silencing Approaches*:
Strategies to overcome multi drug resistance by silencing the expression of gene encoding P-gp efflux transporter, i.e., MDR-1 or Survivin through RNA interference (RNAi) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been explored. The mechanisms include:

- **siRNA Delivery**: The siRNAs assembles into endoribonuclease inside the cells containing complexes known as RNA-Induced Silencing Complexes (RISCs) which guides the RISCs to complementary RNA molecules, cleaving and destroying the target RNA
- **Combined Therapeutic Approaches**: Biotin-functionalized nanoparticles co-encapsulating paclitaxel and P-gp targeted siRNA partially overcame tumor drug resistance

*Oxidative Stress Modulation*:
Restoring the oxidative stress sensitivity of MDR cells to enhance the cytotoxicity of antitumor drugs, as well as identifying novel targets to restore cancer cell response to chemotherapies and immunotherapies, may serve as potential therapeutic strategies to overcome MDR.

**Clinical Examples of MDR Reversal**:

*Mesoporous Silica Systems*:
Doxorubicin MSNPs surface conjugated with TAT peptide facilitated intranuclear drug localization in multidrug resistant MCF-7/ADR cancer cells and overcome MDR compared to free Doxorubicin.

*PLGA-based Systems*:
Biotin or folic acid functionalized PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating Tariquidar and Paclitaxel resulted in higher cytotoxicity and inhibited tumor growth in human MDR tumor xenografts compared to Paclitaxel nanoparticles alone.

*Liposomal Co-delivery*:
Transferrin coated liposomes co-encapsulating Doxorubicin and Verapamil exhibited 5 and 3-fold cytotoxicity in Doxorubicin-resistant human erythroleukemia K562 cells compared to non-targeted liposomes and transferrin targeted liposomes with Doxorubicin alone respectively.

### 27.1.4 Clinical Translation and Challenges

**Approved Nanotherapeutics**

Several nanotechnology-based cancer drug therapies have been approved by the FDA and are already on the market. The true measure of nanotechnology success in medicine and oncology lies in effectively translating research discoveries into the clinic for improved disease diagnosis and treatment. In the past decade, sixteen nanoparticle (NP) formulations have gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and over 1000 new clinical trials have begun. Among the FDA approved nanoformulations, eight are clinically used for cancer imaging or therapy. Key approved nanotherapeutics include:

**Doxil® (Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin)**

Doxil®, the first FDA-approved nano-drug (1995), represents a landmark achievement in cancer nanomedicine. This formulation addresses the significant toxicity issues associated with free doxorubicin, a highly effective but toxic anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent.

*Mechanism of Drug Encapsulation and Delivery*:
Doxil® is based on three unrelated principles that work synergistically:

1. **PEGylated Nano-liposomes**: Prolonged drug circulation time and avoidance of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) due to the use of PEGylated nano-liposomes. The PEG coating provides "stealth" properties that help evade immune recognition.
  
2. **Remote Loading Technology**: High and stable remote loading of doxorubicin driven by a transmembrane ammonium sulfate gradient. An ammonium sulfate (pH) gradient is used to load and stably retain doxorubicin in the liposome interior. This gradient allows for drug release at the tumor site when the liposomes encounter the slightly acidic tumor microenvironment.
  
3. **Lipid Bilayer Composition**: The liposome lipid bilayer exists in a "liquid ordered" phase composed of high-Tm (53 °C) phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, providing enhanced stability and controlled drug release.
  

*Clinical Impact*:
Doxil was the first nanotherapeutic approved to treat cancer and is used for treating ovarian cancer, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and multiple myeloma. The clinically approved formulations reduced cardiotoxicity and hematological toxicity compared to free doxorubicin. In Jerusalem's "first in man Doxil clinical trial" (1991-1994), Doxil demonstrated high and selective tumor localization, providing the first proof for the EPR effect induced in tumors by passive targeting in humans.

**Abraxane® (Albumin-bound Paclitaxel Nanoparticles)**

Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel; ABI 007) represents the first nanotechnology-based drug in cancer treatment, addressing the solvent-related toxicity issues of conventional paclitaxel formulations.

*Innovative Delivery Mechanism*:
Abraxane is a 130-nm, albumin-based nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel that is clinically used for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The formulation exploits natural delivery mechanisms:

1. **Solvent-Free Formulation**: Eliminates Cremophor EL, the toxic solvent used in conventional paclitaxel, thereby removing the need for premedication with steroids and antihistamines and reducing hypersensitivity reactions.
  
2. **Albumin-Mediated Transport**: nab-Paclitaxel is a solvent-free, albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel that takes advantage of the increased delivery of albumin to tumors through receptor-mediated transport called transcytosis. nab-Paclitaxel binds to gp60, the albumin receptor on endothelial cells, which in turn activates caveolin-1 and the formation of caveolae.
  
3. **SPARC-Mediated Release**: In the tumoral interstitium, SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) is selectively secreted by the tumors and binds to albumin-bound paclitaxel with the resultant release of paclitaxel in the vicinity of tumor cells.
  

*Clinical Success*:
Abraxane was approved by the FDA in 2005 for breast cancer, 2010 for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 2013 for pancreatic cancer. The formulation allows administration of higher paclitaxel doses (260 mg/m²) compared to conventional paclitaxel (175 mg/m²) with reduced toxicity and improved efficacy. In 2014, Abraxane's sales were $848 million, representing a 31 percent year-over-year increase.

**Other Approved Nanotherapeutics**

- **DaunoXome®** (liposomal daunorubicin): Approved in 1996 for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma
- **Myocet®** (non-PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin): Available in Europe and Canada

**Major Biological Barriers to Clinical Translation**

**The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)**

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) constitutes a microvascular network responsible for excluding most drugs from the brain, representing one of the most formidable challenges in nanomedicine. The BBB is a barrier that separates the blood from the brain tissue and possesses unique characteristics that make the delivery of drugs to the brain a great challenge.

<div align="center">
<img src="images/chapter27/27-1-4.jpg" alt="The Blood-Brain Barrier" width="50%">
  </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong> Figure 27.5 The Blood-Brain Barrier </strong> This image shows a dense network of blood vessels (red) and nuclei (blue) obtained from mouse brain tissue that was optically cleared to look deeper into the tissue than otherwise possible. The brain’s blood vessels are nearly impermeable, allowing only the passage of key nutrients while blocking that of harmful substances. Unfortunately, this blood-brain barrier (BBB) also excludes most therapeutics. By designing drug-containing nanoparticles that can “hitchhike” across the BBB, researchers hope to finally penetrate the barrier, and deliver life-saving drugs to cancers in the brain. Pictured here is brain tissue before exposure to the experimental nanoparticles.  <small> Source: Emily Wyatt, Mark Davis, California Institute of Technology via NCI Visuals Online </small></em></p>

*Structural and Functional Characteristics*:
The BBB consists of brain endothelial cells connected by tight junctions (TJs) that restrict paracellular transport, along with specialized efflux pumps and limited transcytosis pathways. Because the brain is such a vital organ, the blood vessels surrounding the brain are much more restrictive than other blood vessels in the body, to keep out potentially harmful molecules. The fact that almost 98% of drugs are unable to overcome the BBB is the main reason for employment of nanocarriers in high-grade glioma treatment.

*Nanoparticle Transport Mechanisms Across the BBB*:
Nanoparticles can exploit several transport mechanisms to cross the BBB:

1. **Paracellular Transport**: Small lipophilic cationic NPs can passively diffuse across the cell membranes of BBB endothelial cells. Their small size is advantageous for paracellular transport across the TJs.
  
2. **Carrier-Mediated Transport (CMT)**: Takes advantage of endogenous BBB transporters needed for entry of molecules for homeostasis and neuronal health.
  
3. **Receptor-Mediated Transcytosis (RMT)**: Recognition of a ligand on the NP by a membrane receptor, including transferrin receptor (TfR), insulin receptor (IR), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors.
  
4. **Adsorptive-Mediated Transcytosis (AMT)**: Favorable interactions between the surfaces of NPs and the endothelial membrane through negatively charged clathrin-coated pits and caveolae.
  

*Clinical Challenges*:
Treatment of brain tumors is limited by the impermeability of the BBB and, consequently, survival outcomes for malignant brain tumors remain poor. In the context of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the surrounding brain parenchyma consists of a dense matrix which gives rise to elevated interstitial pressure, further limiting nanoparticle penetration.

**Protein Corona Formation and Opsonization**

When nanoparticles are exposed to biological fluids, such as plasma, opsonins and other biomolecules rapidly adsorb to the surface. This protein corona represents the "true identity" of NP in our body and fundamentally alters nanoparticle behavior.

*Mechanism of Protein Corona Formation*:
The protein corona spontaneously develops and evolves on the surface of nanoscale materials when they are exposed to biological environments, altering their physiochemical properties and affecting their subsequent interactions with biosystems. Upon entering into the biological environments, the surface of the nanoparticles is immediately coated with proteins and form the so-called a protein corona due to which a nanoparticle changes its "synthetic" identity to a new "biological" identity.

*Components and Classification*:
The protein corona consists of two distinct layers:

1. **Hard Corona**: Proteins with high affinity that remain tightly bound to the nanoparticle surface for extended periods
2. **Soft Corona**: Proteins with lower affinity and higher tendency to desorb from NPs' surfaces and tend to be exchanged with other proteins

*Opsonins and Dysopsonins*:
Two types of proteins can be distinguished in the corona:

**Opsonins**: Proteins that reduce the half-life of NPs and accelerate their degradation in vivo by activating the immune system. The most important opsonins include:

- Complement proteins (C1q, C3, C3b): C3, which is the most abundant complement protein in serum, activates an immunological response for the removal of foreign materials
- Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM): Mark NPs for phagocytic uptake
- Fibrinogen: Promotes coagulation and immune recognition

**Dysopsonins**: Proteins that prevent immune recognition and RES uptake:

- Albumin: The most abundant protein in blood, exerts dysopsonin effects and can initiate receptor-mediated endocytosis
- Clusterin (CLU): Plays a predominant role as a dysopsonin, reducing opsonization and RES uptake
- Apolipoproteins: Play significant roles in blood circulation and NPs capacity to cross biological barriers

**The Reticuloendothelial System (RES)**

The reticuloendothelial system (RES) is part of the immune system and consists of phagocytic cells such as monocytes and macrophages located primarily in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.

*Clearance Mechanisms*:
A major hurdle that alters nanomedicine effectiveness is mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) clearance. Intravenously injected NPs are generally recognized as foreign materials and processed through:

1. **Opsonization**: Adsorption of opsonins onto nanoparticle surfaces
2. **Complement Activation**: Activation of complement cascade leading to C3b deposition
3. **Macrophage Recognition**: Phagocytic cells recognize opsonized particles via complement receptors (CRs) and Fc gamma receptors (FcγR)
4. **Phagocytosis and Clearance**: Rapid elimination from bloodstream, resulting in undesirable nanotoxicity

A meta-analysis showed that an estimated 0.7% of injected NPs reach solid tumor tissue, whereas the vast majority accumulated in non-tumor sites including the liver and spleen.

**Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) Effect Limitations**

*EPR Effect Variability*:
Solid and malignant tumours are highly heterogenous resulting in disparate tumour permeability, unfavourable for passive targeting. The EPR effect is thought to provide less than a 2-fold increase in drug delivery at tumour sites compared to healthy tissues.

*Tumor Microenvironment Challenges*:
Despite the emphasis on extravasation and accumulation in NP delivery, deep and uniform tumour penetration of nanotherapeutics may also be crucial for optimal outcomes. Tumour growth produces intratumoural mechanical stress due to elevated cellular proliferation within a limited area termed 'Growth-induced solid stress'. This compression can act as a barrier for adequate delivery of NP delivery systems at the target site.

**Manufacturing and Regulatory Challenges**

*Complex Manufacturing Requirements*:
Issues surrounding complexity in manufacturing and characterization, lack of understanding of in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, acute and chronic toxicity, and cost-effectiveness present significant challenges. The experimental development of NNMs (nanoparticulate nanomedicines) is progressing at a fast pace, however significant challenges still exist in promoting these platforms into clinically feasible therapies.

*Regulatory Pathway Complexity*:
Although diverse nanocarriers have traversed preclinical phases and garnered approvals for human trials, a mere fraction have secured authorization for clinical deployment, particularly those with molecular moieties designed for selective cancer cell interactions. The majority of NNMs in the clinic are for the treatment of cancer, predominantly by the parenteral route of administration, and are structurally based on simple nanomedicine platforms.

*Safety and Toxicity Assessment*:
Toxicological profile of nanoparticles should be robustly assessed. When systemically administered, nanostructures interact with various host biomolecules, and may trigger toxicity. Therefore, comprehensive in vitro cellular models call for evaluation of physicochemical properties, dose, and time of action of nanomaterials.

**Current Clinical Landscape**

*Statistical Overview*:
In recent analysis of the clinical landscape of therapeutic nanoparticles, over 25 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved nanomedicines and over 45 other nanoparticle technologies were identified as being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. In these past years since initial reviews, two intravenously administered nanoparticles have been FDA and EMA approved.

*Translation Success Rate*:
With the integration of nanotechnology into the medical field at large, great strides have been made in the development of nanomedicines for tackling different diseases, including cancers. However, the translation from bench to bedside remains challenging, with various cancer nanomedicines having demonstrated success in preclinical studies but facing significant hurdles in clinical translation.

**Future Opportunities and Strategies**

**Overcoming Biological Barriers**

*BBB Penetration Strategies*:
Recent breakthrough approaches for crossing the BBB include:

- Ultrasound-mediated BBB opening for temporary permeabilization
- Cell-mediated targeting using nanoparticles that exploit cellular transport mechanisms
- Biomimetic approaches using cell membrane-coated nanoparticles

*Protein Corona Engineering*:
Understanding protein corona formation has revealed opportunities to:

- Design nanoparticles with beneficial corona compositions
- Exploit natural targeting mechanisms through corona proteins
- Develop personalized nanomedicine approaches based on patient-specific protein patterns

**Precision Medicine Integration**

*Patient-Specific Approaches*:
By gaining a deeper insight into nano–bio interactions and the personalization of nanomedicines, the field is moving toward:

- Biomarker-guided nanoparticle selection
- Patient-specific corona profiling for treatment optimization
- Real-time monitoring of nanoparticle behavior and therapeutic response

*Advanced Manufacturing and Quality Control*:

- Continuous manufacturing processes for consistent nanoparticle production
- Quality by design approaches for reproducible formulations
- Automated production systems with real-time monitoring capabilities

The full power of nanotechnology will require an era of spectacular advances in the development of processes to integrate nanoscale components into devices, accompanied by the ability to do so reliably at low cost. Success in clinical translation will depend on continued collaboration between researchers, clinicians, regulatory agencies, and industry to address these complex challenges while maintaining focus on patient safety and therapeutic efficacy.
## 27.2 Nanomaterials for Imaging and Diagnosis

Recent advances in nanotechnology, accompanied by our growing understanding of cancer biology and nano-bio interactions, have led to the development of a series of nanocarriers, which aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity. Nanomaterials have revolutionized medical imaging by providing superior contrast, specificity, and sensitivity compared to conventional imaging agents. These materials exploit unique physicochemical properties at the nanoscale to enhance diagnostic capabilities.

### 27.2.1 Quantum Dots for Cancer Imaging

**Fundamental Properties**

Quantum dots (QDs) are the luminescent nanocrystals (NCs) that provide a multifunctional platform for imaging the biosystems following controlled delivery of therapeutic drugs, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, and genes. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals that emit fluorescence on excitation with a light source. Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale nanomaterials that are said to be zero-dimensional because charge carriers are confined so tightly in three directions. Many of their unique properties arise because semiconducting nanocrystals from 2–10 nm diameter are smaller than or equal to their exciton Bohr radius.

*Unique Optical Characteristics*:
Flexible surface chemistry, unique optical properties, high sensitivity, and multiplexing capabilities of QDs certainly make them a most promising tool for personalized medicine:

- Size-tunable emission wavelengths due to quantum confinement effects
- Broad absorption spectra with narrow, symmetric emission peaks
- Superior photostability compared to organic fluorophores
- High quantum yields and brightness

**Cancer Detection Applications**

QDs might serve as potential, more sensitive and specific methods of detection than conventional methods applied in cancer molecular targeting and bio-imaging. The advantages over conventional imaging include:

*Enhanced Sensitivity*:

- Detection of single molecules and small cell populations
- Superior signal-to-noise ratio
- Resistance to photobleaching allows long-term imaging

*Multiplexed Imaging*:
Because of quantum confinement effects, QDs can be excited by a single wavelength but emit at different wavelengths depending on their size, enabling simultaneous detection of multiple targets.

**Advanced Quantum Dot Systems**

*Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs)*:
Carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) have been shown to have promising application value in tumor diagnosis. These biocompatible alternatives offer:

- pH-triggered drug release, and can be used for theranostic purposes. Nitrogen and sulphur doping has been beneficial for extended imaging
- Biocompatible, facilitate pH-triggered drug release, and can be used for theranostic purposes
- Reduced toxicity compared to semiconductor QDs

*Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs)*:
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were conjectured to produce new or improve current methods used for bioimaging, drug delivery, and biomarker sensors for early detection of diseases. Applications include:

- Quinic acid conjugated N-CQDs showed interesting features like tumor accumulation and luminescence, indicating that they might be useful as multifunctional theranostic agents
- Combined imaging and drug delivery capabilities

**In Vivo Tumor Targeting**

Multifunctional nanoparticle probes based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for cancer targeting and imaging in living animals have shown promising results. In vivo targeting studies of human prostate cancer growing in nude mouse show that the QD probes can be delivered to tumor sites by both enhanced permeation and retention (passive targeting) and by antibody binding to cancer-specific cell surface biomarkers such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (active targeting).

*Advanced Targeting Strategies*:
Carbon quantum dots, functionalized with multiple paired α-carboxyl and amino groups that bind to the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (which is expressed in most tumors), selectively accumulate in human tumour xenografts in mice.

*Clinical Applications*:

- Sentinel lymph node mapping in cancer staging
- Real-time surgical guidance
- Monitoring of therapeutic response

### 27.2.2 Magnetic Nanoparticles for MRI Enhancement

**Iron Oxide Nanoparticles**

The development of nano-imaging through fluorescent imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to detect and diagnose cancer at an earlier stage than with current imaging methods.

*Contrast Enhancement Mechanisms*:
* T1 and T2 relaxation time modification
* Concentration-dependent signal enhancement
* Tissue-specific accumulation patterns

**Clinical Applications**

*Lymph Node Metastasis Detection*:

## 27.3 Theranostics and Multifunctional Platforms

Theranostics, the integration of diagnostics and therapies, has become a new concept in the battles with various major diseases such as cancer. Theranostics represents the convergence of diagnostics and therapeutics in a single nanoplatform, enabling personalized medicine approaches through real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.


### 27.3.1 Concept and Design Principles

**Definition and Scope**

Due to the variability and strong adaptability of cancer cells, they could adjust their structure or cell properties to adapt to the surrounding environment and continue to survive, which undoubtedly brings huge obstacles to treatment. However, a single functional nanoparticle drug delivery system seems not to be sufficient for diversified tumor treatment strategies.

The term theranostics was originally coined to describe a treatment platform that combined a diagnostic test with targeted therapy based on the test results. The current nanotheranostics utilize controlled drug vehicles and contain cargo, targeting ligands, and imaging labels for delivery to specific tissues, cells, or subcellular components.

**Multifunctional Design Requirements**

*Essential Components*:
Multifunctional nanoparticles integrate different functions to further expand the carrier's application, thus achieving two or more capacities:

- Therapeutic payload (drugs, genes, proteins)
- Imaging agents (fluorescent, magnetic, radioactive)
- Targeting ligands (antibodies, peptides, aptamers)
- Biocompatible carriers (liposomes, polymers, inorganic cores)

*Design Considerations*:

- Size optimization for EPR effect and cellular uptake
- Surface modification for prolonged circulation
- Controlled release mechanisms
- Biocompatibility and biodegradability

*Pancreatic Cancer Theranostics*:
Theranostics are the next generation therapeutics with both imaging and treatment agents encapsulated in a single nanocarrier. HER-PGFIO showed the magnetic moment of 10emu/g, relaxivity (r2) of 773mM-1s-1 and specific absorption rate (SAR) of 183W/g.

**Polymeric Theranostic Systems**

*Nanohydrogels*:
Nanohydrogels are cross-linked hydrophilic soft polymers organized in a tridimensional network comprising a large fraction of water. This nanocarrier is promising for multimodality treatment, especially for peptides, proteins, and oligonucleotides, because of their hydrophilicity and efficient cell uptake.

*Polymersomes*:
Polymersome could be valuable for melanoma treatment owing to its benefits, such as robustness, increased drug loading, constancy, relatively longer in vivo circulation, and the possibility to design it for the delivery of multiple drugs.

**Inorganic Theranostic Platforms**

*Multifunctional Gold-Based Systems*:
Some metals, such as gold (Au) and Gadolinium (Gd), can have antitumor activity besides being an imaging tracer. Bimetallic theranostic nanoparticle, Bi2S3@BSA–Au–BSA–MTX–Cur, in which they used BSA to Bi2S3 nanoparticles by biomineralization and modified them with Au nanoparticles to deliver methotrexate (MTX) and curcumin. Gd-based nanoparticles (AGuIX) were successfully used as both MRI contrast agent and therapy in experimental animal models of melanoma metastases.

*Magnetic Theranostics*:
Red blood cells are attached to iron oxide nanoparticles pre-coated with chlorine e6, a photosensitizer, and then loaded with a chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin, to enable imaging-guided combined photodynamic and chemotherapy of cancer. The characteristic properties of nanoparticles result in their theranostic potential allowing for simultaneous detection of and treatment of the disease, particularly through magnetic hyperthermia therapy combined with MRI guidance.

A multifunctional melanin-like polydopamine (PDA) nanocarrier decorated with a small-molecule PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) inhibitor. Compared with the corresponding non-targeted probe, our targeted probe induced higher cellular uptake in vitro (6.5-fold) and more tumor accumulation in vivo (4.6-fold).

*Combination Therapy Platforms*:
A multifunctional nanoplatform, which is developed by covalently grafting core-shell structured upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with nanographene oxide (NGO). A remarkably improved and synergistic therapeutic effect compared to PTT (photothermal therapy) or PDT (photodynamic therapy) alone is obtained.
